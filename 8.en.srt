1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,726
If you say you don’t care and have no feelings left,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,880
do you still keep that person’s stuff?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,120
Doc!

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,040
Has Dee already come back?

5
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,280
Do you know where Dr. Dee is?

6
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,480
Yak.

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,160
Since our relationship is already fake, if we want to end it,

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,400
we should break up in a fake way too, right?

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,480
If I win, can I ask for something in return?

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,960
What do you want?

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,160
Give me your first kiss if I win.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
Are you consoling me?

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,440
Yes.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
But this kiss is all from me.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,280
Nothing to do with the reward.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Doc.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,800
If you take it back again,

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,680
you’re a dead man.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,600
I wouldn’t dare.

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,320
This hottest and most dashing boxer

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
is yours.

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,480
Here.

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
Souvenir from Japan.

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,600
My new toys?

25
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,640
You and your dirty mind!

26
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,320
Thank you.

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,080
That day when I told you to go back,

28
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,480
I apologize.

29
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
I was concerned because your boxing match was coming up,

30
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,880
and I didn’t want you to get hurt unnecessarily.

31
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,840
As for Dr. Ter,

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,480
you should already know I no longer have feelings for him.

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,280
I just didn’t want a doctor to get physically injured

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,280
since he needs to be in great form to treat patients.

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,840
If he weren’t a doctor, I would have let you beat him up.

36
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,480
About that day,

37
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,680
I also want to apologize

38
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,440
for being a little too hot-headed.

39
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,600
Didn't seem like just a little to me.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,280
You broke up with me.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
My apologies.

42
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
I promise I won’t do that again.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,480
Come on, let’s reconcile.

44
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,000
Alright.

45
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,480
I don’t want to see someone being a crybaby.

46
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,600
Give me a break, Doc.

47
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,080
No.

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,000
Good stuff happens only once.

49
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,000
What, Doc?

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,280
Come on.

51
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,920
No. Learn to wait.

52
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,680
Then.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,640
Yak.

54
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,440
I’ll do this instead.

55
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,360
Yak.

56
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,440
1, 2

57
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,760
1, 2

58
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,040
4 punches.

59
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,000
Jab.

60
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,000
Jab.

61
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,080
1, 2

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,400
1, 2

63
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,600
Jab

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,600
1, 2

65
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,080
1, 2

66
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,560
1, 2

67
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,000
4 punches.

68
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,520
1, 2

69
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,560
Jab.

70
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,360
Jab.

71
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,280
Dr. Dee.

72
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,280
You’re here so early.

73
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
Just got back from Japan?

74
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,760
Yes.

75
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,320
Yak.

76
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,080
Sorry, Cher.

77
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,640
I made you worry.

78
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,880
Can you hold this for me?

79
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,000
Are those two going to start a fight?

80
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,240
No, they won't.

81
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,960
They're actually very loving brothers.

82
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,920
After their father started a new family and moved to Kanchanaburi,

83
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Yei has been taking care of Yak,

84
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,480
like a second father.

85
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,840
Oyei could never stay mad at Yak for too long.

86
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,560
I hope it’s like you said.

87
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,600
I was so skinny back then, right?

88
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,000
I looked like a house lizard standing next to you.

89
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,360
Do you remember,

90
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,640
after we took this photo,

91
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,440
what you said to me?

92
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,520
"I will become the 3rd world champion of our family.

93
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,680
Wait and see.

94
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,440
Yei, can you help me become a world champion?"

95
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,840
Then I asked,

96
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,080
"It's not that easy to become a world champion.

97
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,400
Are you sure?"

98
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,600
Yei…

99
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
I promise…

101
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,240
I won’t let that happen again.

102
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,400
You don’t need to promise me.

103
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,000
I trust you.

104
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,280
Go get it.

105
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,280
Remember you’ll always have me on your team.

106
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,840
Thank you, Yei.

107
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,280
You haven’t eaten yet?

108
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
Huh, Yak?

109
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,400
Who could eat anything after all that happened?

110
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,400
How about this?

111
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
Let’s have a Somtam party today.

112
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,040
What do you say?

113
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,520
Why not?

114
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,480
I’ll be the cook today.

115
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
How do you like it?

116
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,880
Hot and spicy!

117
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,400
Okay, you’ll get it.

118
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,240
Hot and spicy?

119
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,000
Mouthwatering Somtam is ready.

120
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,880
Phadetseuk folks, get ready!

121
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,600
Hail to Manager Cher!

122
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,880
Hail to Manager Cher!

123
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,600
Hail to Manager Cher!

124
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,440
Yeah!

125
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,880
Wait!

126
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,679
Anyone who lays a hand on my boyfriend

127
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,800
will get kicked out of the club!

128
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,600
Let’s sit down and eat then.

129
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,400
Hey, don’t tease them.

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,840
Do you want to start eating now?

131
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,000
Let’s pound.

132
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,760
Pound?

133
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
Somtam!

134
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,560
First step, garlic.

135
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,240
- Sugar palm?
- Yes.

136
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,640
Stop.

137
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,200
Let me take it from here.

138
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,680
Enough.

139
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,560
Here you are.

140
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,240
Somtam by your little bro Yoryak.

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,200
Little bro indeed. Is this Somtam for kids?

142
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,400
There’s no chili at all.

143
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,720
This kid himself is already hot enough, ain’t he?

144
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
Aww.

145
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,480
If you want something spicy, try this one.

146
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,040
Here.

147
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,840
Try it.

148
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,560
How is it?

149
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,120
Yummy, no doubt.

150
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,400
By the way, that necklace on you suits way better than on Yak.

151
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,120
Hey, Dr. Dee.

152
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,800
If Yak acts up again, throw the necklace away.

153
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,160
Are you born an instigator?

154
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,760
Oyei, reprimand your guy.

155
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,880
You can count on me.

156
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,080
I’ll punish him for you.

157
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,480
Tell me how many rounds you need tonight.

158
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,400
What do you mean by ‘rounds’? You pervy man!

159
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,040
Yak!

160
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
Ready, guys? Be peppy.

161
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
One, two, three.

162
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,760
New pose.

163
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,200
One, two, three.

164
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,200
Cute pose.

165
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,720
One, two, three.

166
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,240
Taem.

167
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,800
Huh?

168
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,160
What was it again that you wanted me to do?

169
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,040
Ah, could you chase after that task from Engineering for me?

170
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,800
Sure, got it.

171
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,800
Thank you.

172
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,080
We need to pull another all-nighter tonight.

173
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,280
By the way, Taem.

174
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,640
Have you managed to get hold of Yoryak yet?

175
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,680
I saw his IG.

176
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:39,680
He’s already back at his boxing club.

177
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,000
So he didn’t get back to you at all?

178
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,400
What the hell?

179
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,280
You both called and texted him.

180
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,960
If you hadn’t been tied up with our council’s urgent tasks,

181
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,440
you’d probably be searching for him all over Bangkok, right?

182
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,720
Yak must've been busy.

183
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,080
Plus, he just lost the fight.

184
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,800
He’s probably not ready.

185
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,960
When he feels okay, he’ll probably contact me.

186
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,400
Doc.

187
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,880
What?

188
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Give me an oil massage.

189
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,880
Like what those two are doing.

190
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,680
Why should I?

191
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,920
So I can have energy for my training.

192
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,640
Come on, help me out.

193
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,600
Alright.

194
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,080
How do I do it?

195
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,960
Start with this leg first.

196
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,600
What’s wrong?

197
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,960
Why are you acting all strange?

198
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,880
Nothing!

199
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,080
Yei.

200
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,320
Huh?

201
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,320
So how many fights did I get canceled?

202
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,440
Not a lot.

203
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,400
Come on. You can tell me.

204
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,280
Two. It’s fine.

205
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,200
I’m sorry, Yei.

206
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,280
Do these two removals have an adverse effect on him?

207
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,600
Just a bit.

208
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,480
But that fight didn’t affect his world ranking.

209
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,400
We just lost some income.

210
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,880
This is normal in the boxing industry, Dr. Dee.

211
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,880
Luckily, Yei told the judges that

212
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,719
Yak had a serious stomach ache

213
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,360
so he couldn’t throw punches.

214
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,960
They just warned us to make sure something like that won’t happen again.

215
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,280
My boyfriend is so good at making up stories.

216
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,600
So what exactly happened, Yak?

217
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,400
Nothing to worry about.

218
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,680
I was sick like you told them.

219
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,680
It could be trauma or some form of mental issue with Yak.

220
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,440
Is it a serious health threat?

221
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,160
No, if he receives treatment early.

222
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,160
He could now see hallucinations during his matches.

223
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,280
Before, he could only see them in his dreams.

224
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,200
With trauma issues, if left untreated for a longer period,

225
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,560
they can affect both mental and physical health.

226
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,880
Hey, could you bring Yoryak to see me?

227
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,400
Sure, help take care of him for me.

228
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,560
With pleasure.

229
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,480
Good morning.

230
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,280
Morning.

231
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,280
This is coming around again?

232
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
The hospital’s anniversary.

233
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,960
I’m done.

234
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,800
I’ll pass.

235
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:12,800
(Wonderful Night - Special Night with Special Someone - 30 Years Anniversary)

236
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,280
A ball event, "Wonderful Night - Special Night with Special Someone."

237
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,880
The title already sounds like fun.

238
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
You go for it. It’s not my cup of tea.

239
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,040
I'll give you money to donate instead.

240
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
What? Why?

241
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,520
You have to come with me.

242
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,600
I think it’s gonna be fun.

243
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,520
I really love the idea—

244
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,600
a special night where everyone

245
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,400
can do something out of the ordinary together.

246
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,680
You go ahead. I'm sure you'll have fun.

247
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,600
But count me out.

248
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,960
It's gonna be fine.

249
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,280
You seem to be walking much better today.

250
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,080
I've been following your advice closely.

251
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,080
Great.

252
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,320
Mrs. Noppawan, your medicine is ready.

253
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,200
Dee.

254
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,120
Dr. Ter.

255
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,760
You’re back.

256
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,200
How was your trip?

257
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,360
It’s alright, but not as great as I thought,

258
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,400
because you didn’t stay back with me.

259
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
I told you even before we went there

260
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,880
that I would rush back once the seminar concluded.

261
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,400
Anyway, did you see this?

262
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,360
I remember how fond you are of this event.

263
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,960
And this year it’s a ball event.

264
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,240
I would like to ask you to go with me.

265
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,320
Dr. Ter.

266
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,640
You saw the poster for this event?

267
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,880
I was about to find you.

268
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Hi, Dr. Dee.

269
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,760
Hi.

270
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,840
Congrats on the outstanding presentation award in Japan.

271
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,200
Thank you very much.

272
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,880
I actually didn’t do much.

273
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,840
Dr. Ter is great at presenting.

274
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
Give yourself some credit.

275
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,119
You prepared the deck so well.

276
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,880
You presented it so well and received many compliments.

277
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,359
Oh, what were you saying?

278
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,480
Did you mention you were looking for me?

279
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,800
Well,

280
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,680
I would like to ask you to be my dance partner at the ball.

281
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,880
Dr. Nop has been pestering me about it.

282
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,600
Please.

283
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,480
I’ll take it as a yes.

284
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,680
Are you coming to the ball, Dr. Dee?

285
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,600
I wouldn’t miss it.

286
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,080
Great. Do you have a date yet?

287
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,600
Or did I interrupt you two?

288
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,800
Were you asking Dr. Ter?

289
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,480
No.

290
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,840
For this ball,

291
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,840
I must bring my special someone.

292
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,400
Again?

293
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,280
Come on. Just one more time.

294
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,400
Please. Please. Please.

295
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,600
But it’s not really me at all.

296
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,840
If you don’t go with me,

297
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,960
I will have to accept Dr. Ter’s offer.

298
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,320
I have to beg him–

299
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,759
“Dr. Ter, would you please be my dance…”

300
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,440
No.

301
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,120
Don’t.

302
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,720
Stop.

303
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,280
Not even in your thoughts.

304
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,760
Exactly, right?

305
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
So what can I do?

306
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,800
You don’t want to go to the ball with me.

307
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,160
Uh…

308
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,280
Fine.

309
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,680
I’ll go.

310
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,600
But you must do something for me first.

311
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,440
What is it?

312
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,600
Your fish steak is ready.

313
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,000
Hey, Yak!

314
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,560
Looks yummy.

315
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,480
If it looks yummy, then dig in.

316
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,240
If you eat too late,

317
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,880
it’s not good for your health, Boxer guy.

318
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,080
Come on.

319
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,840
I eat late just once in a while, it’s gonna be alright.

320
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,600
Yak. Yak!

321
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,560
Stop. Stop.

322
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,560
Sit back.

323
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,000
Eat your dinner.

324
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,800
Sit.

325
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,120
Should I squeeze the lime?

326
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,480
A little bit.

327
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,560
Try it.

328
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,960
I get to eat Dr. Dee’s cooking now!

329
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:35,840
Yak!

330
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,400
Do you want the whole building to hear?

331
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
I can find you a speaker.

332
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,600
Can I do that?

333
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,440
Bring it.

334
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,600
I’m being sarcastic!

335
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,880
I’m gonna dive in then.

336
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,480
So good.

337
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,000
It would be great to have someone cook delicious dishes for me every day.

338
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,280
I already cooked you a delicious dish.

339
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,600
Can I ask you a favor?

340
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,560
This is the place.

341
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,800
Take off your shoes.

342
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,200
Get in.

343
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,640
Doc.

344
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,600
I think they are too over the top.

345
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,400
Let’s get out of here.

346
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:45,640
No, come on.

347
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,080
Hi.

348
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,880
How may I help you?

349
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,400
The costumes for the theme of your ball are on that side.

350
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,400
We have ordinary clothes as well as prince and princess gowns.

351
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,720
We also have costumes for all the fairy tale characters.

352
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
Feel free to look around and pick what you like.

353
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,840
What do you think?

354
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,320
You look really good in this outfit.

355
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,960
You too, Doc.

356
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,120
Let’s go with these then.

357
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,040
Deal.

358
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,960
We’ve got the outfits,

359
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,280
next is…

360
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,160
Are you taking this too seriously?

361
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,400
Come on. It’s a ball event.

362
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,120
Give it a try.

363
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,560
Dancing is about rhythm,

364
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,960
trust,

365
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,800
and the dynamic exchange of leading and following.

366
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,360
It’s the harmonious coordination of two people

367
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,520
to make it perfect and beautiful.

368
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,360
Let’s begin.

369
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,240
First dance step – Forward and Backward.

370
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,800
Let’s start.

371
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,600
1, 2, 3 tap.

372
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,080
1, 2, 3 tap.

373
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,960
Then we’re going to add some tricks–

374
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,360
Underarm Turn,

375
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,680
followed by New York,

376
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,400
and end with Underarm Turn.

377
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,360
Woah.

378
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,240
1, 2, 3, 4.

379
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,800
1, 2, 3, together.

380
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
1, 2…

381
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,400
Yak, take it easy.

382
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,080
Try to get your groove. Okay?

383
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,600
Let’s count together.

384
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,640
1, 2, 3. Here we go.

385
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,200
1, 2, 3, 4.

386
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,280
1, 2, 3, tap.

387
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,360
Great.

388
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,720
1, 2, 3.

389
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,400
Here you are.

390
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,840
Cheers.

391
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,400
1, 2, 3, tap.

392
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,800
1, 2, 3, tap.

393
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,920
1, 2, 3, tap.

394
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,320
Thank you, Mrs. Monthakarn,

395
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,520
for today.

396
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,480
Change your "thank you" to "promise" instead.

397
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,400
If you have any more fun like this, you must call me.

398
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,880
Definitely, I'll call you.

399
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,280
By the way,

400
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,800
you and Yoryak

401
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,080
will continue pretending to be boyfriends like this, really?

402
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,680
Yes, Grandma.

403
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,280
Only two months left, and our deal will end.

404
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,680
I don’t understand what young people do.

405
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,600
Time and love? Like Cinderella?

406
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,440
When the time is up,

407
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,200
if you truly love me, you must find me or something like that?

408
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm afraid that when the time is up,

409
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,960
Yak will disappear completely.

Hey, Yei.

412
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,760
Hold on.

413
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,680
You can’t go straight to bed after a shower.

414
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,600
Did you forget something?

415
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,920
Ah.

416
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,960
I mean you forgot to apply this serum.

417
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,280
Oh, that. Yes.

418
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,640
I’ll do it for you.

419
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,920
Alright. Done.

420
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,240
Let me return the favor.

421
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,600
Come here.

422
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,560
Alright.

423
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,600
Done?

424
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,360
Done.

(Senate Approves “Marriage Equality” Bill)

426

I can’t believe this day will finally happen.
(Senate Approves “Marriage Equality” Bill)

427
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,840
The day that people like us can be legally married.

428
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,200
Yei.

429

Huh?

When things are ready, let’s…

431

register for marriage.

432
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,200
Why not?

433
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,840
Yeah.

434
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,840
But I think we missed a step.

435
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,640
What is it?

436
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,800
You’ve never proposed to me.

437
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,880
Cher.

438
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,480
Yes?

439

We’ve been together for a while.

440

You know every angle of me.

441
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,280
Though I may not always be nice,

442
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,120
I have a sharp tongue

443
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,080
and get moody easily.

444
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,840
But if you give me a chance,

445
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,120
I want to take care of you for the rest of my life.

446

What’s next?

447
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,760
This.

448
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,280
Ah.

449

Look.

Is the ring pretty?

Will you marry me?

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,600
I do.

You're becoming a big softie again, little one.

Your proposal was so sweet.

Now is the time people would cheer for us to kiss.

456

What are you waiting for?

458
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,560
Just tell me if there’s any part you don’t understand.

459
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,240
I don’t understand any of it

460
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,200
Are you messing with me?

461
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,880
Just kidding.

462
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,760
You look serious. I want to make you smile.

463
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
I told you, right?

464
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,680
The Student Council duties are too hard and stressful.

465
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,200
Go and tell them you quit now.

466
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,560
It’s not stressful. It’s fun.

Sure. I’m definitely going.

You should apply to be a Member of Parliament after graduation.

477

I might do it.

I’ll call a ride.

493
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,840
Then come with me.

494
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,160
I can give you a ride.

No.

00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,679
Welcome to the 30th anniversary celebration

514
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,040
of Tanwarin Hospital's foundation.

515
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,760
May I have your applause, please?

516
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,280
This year, our theme is

517
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,600
"Wonderful Night - Special Night with Special Someone."

518
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,960
Are you looking for someone, Vivi?

519
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,320
Dr. Wandee and Mr. Yoryak.

520
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,160
The dance floor is about to open.

521
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,200
Wow,

522
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:55,240
our favorite pair is here, Dr. Ter and Dr. Kwan.

523
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,880
They both look absolutely stunning.

524
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Maybe this pair can take home our special prize.

525
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,080
Don’t rush the result yet.

526
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,879
Everyone is dressed beautifully tonight.

527
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,040
They all have a chance to win the prize.

528
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,320
That’s strange.

529
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,480
I thought he would come with his date.

530
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,120
Dr. Dee, this way.

531
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,680
Where is Mr. Yoryak?

532
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,680
He’ll arrive later.

533
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,200
Then, I’ll wait for Yak outside.

534
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,040
Is there everything you need?

535
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,080
Just one word from you,

536
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,760
and I’ll be your dance partner.

537
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,960
Well, I just remembered that I actually forgot something.

538
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,000
I should go get it now.

539
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,400
Wait, Taem.

540
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,120
I feel so great being with you like this, you know.

541
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,440
You feel the same, right?

542
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,440
What the hell are you doing?

543
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,680
Taem!

544
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,120
You like me, don't you?

545
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,720
I can tell.

546
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,520
Taem!

547
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,360
Taem, listen to me.

548
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,240
Taem!

549
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,600
I know why you joined the Student Council.

550
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,280
It was because you wanted to be close to me.

551
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,440
Don’t be full of yourself.

552
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,520
I joined the Student Council for the university, not for anyone.

553
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,720
I used to see you as a hero.

554
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,720
But now, you're such an asshole.

555
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,200
Taem, come back. We need to talk.

556
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,600
Let go of me.

557
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,680
If you don’t, I’ll shout.

558
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,160
Help!

559
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:10,799
- Help!
- Hey, shut your mouth!

560
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,280
No. Help.

561
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,280
- Help!
- Hey, Taem.

562
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,280
Be quiet.

563
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,840
Quiet! I said be quiet.

564
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,960
Stop! Do what I said.

565
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,520
What the f**k are you doing to her?

566
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,200
Is this the man who dedicates himself to others?

567
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,679
Hey, Taem. It’s a misunderstanding.

568
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,400
Shut up!

569
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,280
Taem, call the police.

570
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,680
Taem, I’m sorry.

571
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,560
We can settle this.

572
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,240
Taem.

573
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,480
Hey!

574
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,600
Dean, I would like to report something.

575
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,240
Taem!

576
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,480
It’s just a misunderstanding.

577
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,840
So, Dee?

578
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,480
I don’t think your fake boyfriend can make it here tonight.

579
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,000
Be my dance partner tonight.

580
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,800
I don’t care anymore what people will think of me.

581
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,800
Because I’ve realized my feelings for you.

582
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,040
Before, I said you were too vanilla.

583
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,120
In fact,

584
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,480
you are very lively and lovely to me.

585
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,440
Every time I see you smile,

586
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,800
every time we do something together,

587
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,760
it feels so great, you know.

588
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,800
Today, I’ve realized my feelings.

589
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,600
I like you, Dee.

590
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,400
I don’t think

591
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,720
you're a suitable dance partner for me.

592
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,320
A good dance

593
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,000
requires harmonious coordination, right?

594
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,240
But you…

595
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,000
You're just too damn vanilla for me.

596
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,440
And I didn’t say that out of sarcasm.

597
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,960
It honestly came from the heart of this good brother of yours.

598
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,400
I’m…

599
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,480
going inside first,

600
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,840
brother.

601
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,560
Dee.

602
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,720
I refuse to believe that.

603
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,280
And I’m not going to give up.

604
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,480
Everyone, our dance time is about to begin.

605
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,840
Please get ready if you have come with your date.

606
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,320
Go to your partner and get ready.

607
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,880
And those who can dance…

608
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,400
If Mr. Yoryak is not here before the dance begins,

609
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,240
you can dance with me.

610
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,360
It’s okay. You are here with your date.

611
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,400
Don’t worry about me.

612
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,200
Let’s toast then.

613
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,800
Alright, everyone. Our dance floor will open any minute now.

614
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,320
That’s right.

615
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:45,800
You can stand next to your partner.

616
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,240
Hold your partner’s hands.

617
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,640
Our judges will confirm your participation.

618
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,080
They will score you from the beginning.

619
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,160
Let’s dance together tonight.

620
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,600
Sure, I’d love to.

621
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,960
It’s time now. Please come to the dance floor.

622
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,720
Go ahead.

623
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,720
Wow, You all look so beautiful.

624
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,320
Please give it all you’ve got.

625
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,880
Everyone, are you ready?

626
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,960
Are you ready?

627
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,800
Yes.

628
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,280
Are you ready, Dr. Ter?

629
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,240
Dr. Ter! Where are you going?

630
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,800
Would you do me the honor of dancing with me, my prince?

631
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,200
With pleasure, my prince.

632
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,880
I used to believe that love wasn’t meant for me

633
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:57,040
Those who came by just didn’t feel right

634
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,720
I don’t know why

635
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:06,279
Then I met you

636
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,280
You made me realize

637
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,440
What true love is actually like

638
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,320
What, Yak?

639
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:18,800
The one I’ve been looking for who feels right

640
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,480
It’s you

641
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,680
Doc.

642
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,640
I think

643
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,880
I love you.

644
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,200
Just having a good day with you

645
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,720
It’s good to have you

646
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,680
Just us having each other, that’s all I could ask for

647
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,440
It’s good that I have you, it's good when I'm with you

648
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,800
All I need is you, that’s already too good to be true

649
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:21,960
I’ll be back with you.

650
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,360
Yak!

651
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,560
You are quite punctual.

652
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,680
Of course.

653
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,600
It’s a bit crowded today.

654
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,240
Some doctors and nurses have a seminar.

655
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,480
No problem. I can wait.

656
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:39,720
Would you like to get it now?

657
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,760
This way, sir.

658
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,880
I’m bringing Mr. Yoryak to get his second HPV shot.

659
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,600
I already booked it.

660
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,360
Alright. But please bear with us. There are quite a lot of patients today.

661
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,800
It’s going to be a long day for you.

662
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,240
Easy-peasy.

663
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,560
HPV rarely shows any signs of infection.

664
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,800
We should get protection before it causes serious health problems later.

665
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,080
Am I right, Mr. Yoryak?

666
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,400
Yes.

667
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,480
But I’m okay to come back later for it.

668
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,880
Don’t worry.

669
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,800
Since you already have an appointment, let's not take up any more of your time.

670
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,320
However, Dr. Wandee…

671
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,520
What can I do to help?

672
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,000
It’s done.

673
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:42,800
Does it hurt?

674
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,400
It kinda does.

675
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,280
Give me a break. I have a very light hand.

676
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,120
If it hurts much, come here alone next time.

677
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,120
I won’t accompany you.

678
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,800
But you’re not just here to accompany me.

679
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,680
You’re here as my sweetheart.

680
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:03,800
You certainly have a way with words.

681
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:05,080
Let’s get you the third shot right away.

682
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,880
No, Doc.

683
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,800
Don’t.

684
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,480
The third HPV shot can wait.

685
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,360
But right now,

686
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,400
I can’t wait any longer.

687
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,120
Wait for what?

688
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,560
Well…

689
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,200
Yak!

690
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,200
I can’t wait to plant a kiss on your cheek.

691
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,280
We’re in the hospital.

692
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,400
So?

693
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,120
Mr. Yoryak!

694
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,440
From now on, I’m going all out to win you over.

695
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,280
What do I have to do to be your boyfriend?

696
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,440
You must give me a flower every day.

697
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,160
Let’s go on a trip. I’ve booked everything.

698
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,640
If I love you, I’ll love you for who you are.

699
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,920
The man who can make me happy every day.

700
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,280
Then, brace yourself for it.

701
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,120
Yak.

702
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,400
Enough!
