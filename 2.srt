4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,153
The hospital has planned to elevate our department to become the premier orthopedic facility.

5
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:26,254
Both of you have been selected as finalists by the board.

6
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:27,707
I like you.

7
00:00:27,707 --> 00:00:30,571
You are too vanilla for me.

8
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:36,728
Are you joking with me, Doc?

9
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:38,467
Want to watch some series together?

10
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,596
You are too vanilla for me.

11
00:00:56,964 --> 00:00:57,892
Am I tasty?

12
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,981
Well, I didn’t expect you to be this tasty either.

13
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:11,393
I’m indeed tasty, right?

14
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:12,424
Um.

15
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,567
Right?

16
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,202
How can someone like me be vanilla?

17
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:21,812
Hey!

18
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:23,865
Boxer guy.

19
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,633
Yoryak. My name is Yoryak.

20
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:28,894
Whatever, tell me honestly.

21
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:30,643
I’m not vanilla, right?

22
00:01:30,643 --> 00:01:31,253
What’s wrong with you?

23
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:33,128
Do you have OCD?

24
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:35,120
Just answer. I really want to know.

25
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:38,505
I can’t remember.

26
00:01:39,257 --> 00:01:42,149
Maybe I need another round to jog my memory.

27
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:44,066
Do you have short-term memory?

28
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:45,246
How come you already forgot?

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,858
Yoryak.

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,379
What?

31
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,028
Stop.

32
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:56,180
Don't you want to know if you really are tasty?

33
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:57,221
Hey,

34
00:01:58,137 --> 00:01:59,139
Yoryak.

35
00:01:59,139 --> 00:01:59,973
Boxer guy.

36
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:02,343
Yoryak,

37
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:03,665
stop.

38
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:11,040
Anyway, thanks for taking me home.

39
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:11,960
My pleasure.

40
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:15,415
Couldn't bear seeing you alone by trash like a little pup.

41
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:18,205
You act all high and mighty during the day,

42
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,001
but when you're drunk, all that haughtiness disappears.

43
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:24,680
It happened only last night, Boxer guy.

44
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,945
If you know you’re a lightweight,

45
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,903
have a friend accompany you when drinking.

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,698
Understand?

47
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:30,305
No fear here.

48
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:34,707
Last night at the bar, no one wanted to do anything with me.

49
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:35,852
Are you being dramatic?

50
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,800
No.

51
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,652
Don’t feel bad about it, though.

52
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:42,519
No need for any awkwardness.

53
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,218
Next time you come for a check-up at the hospital,

54
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:45,880
feel free to see Dr. Nop, as you did before.

55
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,669
We can just act normal around each other.

56
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,000
You may pretend not to know me. Whatever suits you.

57
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,127
One-night stand?

58
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,393
Um. Once is enough.

59
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,276
No next time.

60
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:59,137
So the one “night” quota is used up.

61
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:04,560
But I still have one “day” quota remaining.

62
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:07,963
If you’re interested, add me to your contact.

63
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:12,880
No more one day or one night with you.

64
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,486
Over!

65
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:15,717
Doc.

66
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:18,427
Doc!

67
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:19,678
Doc!

68
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,590
Isn’t it impolite to shut the door in people’s faces?

69
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:23,564
Yes.

70
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,462
Go, go, go go!

71
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:09,352
Good.

72
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:15,000
Please accept my sincere apologies, ma’am.

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,889
Yoryak doesn’t have time for personal coaching.

74
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,468
Initially, he did have some availability.

75
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:22,313
But after winning the recent bout,

76
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:24,551
he needs to train at the camp for the next bout,

77
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:25,482
so he's not available now.

78
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:28,230
Would you like to train with other coaches instead?

79
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,611
I can give you a special discount.

80
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:34,152
Also, I’ll send Oyei, Yoryak’s brother to take care of you exclusively.

81
00:05:34,152 --> 00:05:35,050
What do you think?

82
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,237
(The former world champion Oyei will take care of me?)

83
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,249
Your inner thoughts are quite loud, ma’am.

84
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:41,058
That’s settled then.

85
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:43,439
Thank you for choosing Phadetseuk Boxing Gym.

86
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,766
Goodbye.

87
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,737
You now promote your boyfriend to customers?

88
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:50,678
Yes.

89
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,983
You’ve trained so hard to get this body.

90
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,308
I shouldn’t be the only one to see it.

91
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,362
Yei.

92
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:02,390
Don’t you feel possessive over me a bit?

93
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:04,295
Yei, get off me.

94
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,193
You’re soaking wet with your sweat.

95
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:06,891
Why?

96
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,348
You stink.

97
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,465
My stink repulses you?

98
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:10,591
Um.

99
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:13,208
Let’s go.

100
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:15,080
Go where?

101
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:16,880
You said I stink.

102
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:19,167
I’ll let you clean me.

103
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,649
As for the part you want to smell good…

104
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,350
take care of it yourself.

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,532
You dirty mind!

106
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:26,911
Stop.

107
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:28,271
I have something else to do.

108
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,902
I have to go buy you and our son soy milk.

109
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:32,742
Cher.

110
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,825
No. Do you want soy milk or not?

111
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:38,248
Cher, babe. Come on.

112
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,988
You don’t need to buy it now. Do it later.

113
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:41,919
I must buy it for our son.

114
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,759
You can buy it later.

115
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,046
How could he survive without it?

116
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:45,254
Yei.

117
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:45,973
Come on.

118
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:46,689
Yei.

119
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:47,589
Please.

120
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:48,092
Yei.

121
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:49,848
Yei!

122
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,049
This again?

123
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:55,425
Yes,

124
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:56,948
just gulp it down.

125
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:06,430
Ouch.

126
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:08,660
What’s up with you two again?

127
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,813
Hey, your customers are upset that you don’t do personal training.

128
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:12,733
Sorry, Cher.

129
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,334
Fine. It’s just a shame that we missed out on those course fees.

130
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:18,034
Our gym had to close down for 2 years during Covid.

131
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:19,450
Forget about it, Cher.

132
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:21,436
Don’t force him.

133
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:23,049
He earns more money as a boxer than as a personal trainer.

134
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:25,576
The money we could make from those is not small, Yei.

135
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,821
You do know the expenses for running this boxing gym are quite a lot.

136
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:30,639
You’re like a nagging champion.

137
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,578
Stop it. People don’t nag during breakfast, you know.

138
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:34,374
You little pup.

139
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:35,737
I’m really sorry.

140
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:39,168
The training schedule Oyei made for me is already jam-packed.

141
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,466
Oh, you realize that too.

142
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:43,771
With such a packed schedule, you can still enjoy a night out every night.

143
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:45,234
I go out for tutoring too,

144
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:46,328
not to hit the clubs every night.

145
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:48,788
Where were you last night? You came home in the morning.

146
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:50,053
Yeah, I wonder.

147
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:56,683
Who’s the lucky person who got hold of Yoryak Phadetseuk all night?

148
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:58,688
Usually, you leave right after you finish.

149
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:00,684
Nosy.

150
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,200
Were you under my bed when I was doing it?

151
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:12,225
What’s up?

152
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,109
I’m fine. What about you?

153
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,548
You called to check?

154
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,446
Yes.

155
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:19,548
If anything bad happened to you,

156
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:21,469
I could help arrange your funeral.

157
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,503
I’m not dead yet, you moron.

158
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:25,126
That’s a relief.

159
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,186
So…

160
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,489
which security guard carried you to your room last night?

161
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:31,041
I didn’t really remember.

162
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,943
What are you going to do now about Dr. Ter?

163
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:36,227
Ter who? Who is Ter?

164
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:37,936
I don’t know anyone by that name.

165
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:39,887
Wow. That’s an attitude.

166
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:43,038
I wish I could see when you confront him.

167
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:44,059
It’s gonna happen soon.

168
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,059
Dr. Apichart asked me and…

169
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:48,374
that man to talk about the scholarship.

170
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,640
Really?

171
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:52,116
Do your best on that.

172
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:53,606
I’ll send over my support from here.

173
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:54,490
Thanks.

174
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:55,985
Go do your stuff.

175
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:57,801
Put some money toward your father’s merit-making ceremony on my behalf.

176
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:00,240
Thanks, man. See you.

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,699
4 punches.

178
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:47,888
1 2 hook!

179
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,672
Jab.

180
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:51,029
Jab.

181
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,574
Wait. How’s your shoulder?

182
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:55,000
It got better.

183
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,209
You’re free today, right?

184
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,991
Go have physiotherapy at the hospital.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,509
Okay?

186
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:03,630
Okay. I have nothing else planned for today.

187
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,866
That’s strange. You didn’t object.

188
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:06,770
Why would I?

189
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:08,559
It’s for the benefit of my boxing, right?

190
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:10,970
Come on.

191
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,277
What’s with that soft tone?

192
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:13,453
Alright, keep going.

193
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:14,834
4 punches.

194
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:16,432
1 2 hook.

195
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:18,155
Good.

196
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:18,655
1 2

197
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:19,900
Straight.

198
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,214
Straight.

199
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:22,397
By the way, Yak.

200
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:27,424
I already called the hospital and booked your old doctor.

201
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:28,776
That doctor you told me–

202
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,590
What’s his name? Wandee, right?

203
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:34,063
Why? What’s up?

204
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:35,380
Yei, you.

205
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:36,442
What?

206
00:10:36,982 --> 00:10:38,361
You should have asked me first?

207
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:40,375
I’m telling you right now.

208
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:41,693
Why?

209
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:43,446
Gosh.

210
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:44,498
Where are you going?

211
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,105
To the hospital. My shoulder hurts.

212
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:46,654
Come back.

213
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:47,970
- Yak!
- I said my shoulder hurts.

214
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:49,013
Yak!\Damn this little.

215
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:51,507
Damn this little.

216
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:01,979
How’re you doing?

217
00:11:04,703 --> 00:11:05,546
Dee.

218
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:10,395
After seeing Dr. Apichart, let’s have a coffee together.

219
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:13,138
Dee.

220
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:16,865
Talk to me.

221
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,751
I’m done talking to you.

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,997
Have you already made a decision about the scholarship?

223
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:29,379
Yes, I would like to apply for it.

224
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:33,746
Good. Well then finish up the application form.

225
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:34,570
Understood.

226
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:36,601
What about you, Dee?

227
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:39,370
I talked to him last night. He’ll…

228
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,530
I’m in too.

229
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:46,688
Dr. Ter taught me not to waste any opportunities.

230
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,429
Not everyone gets an opportunity to knock on their doors.

231
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:54,321
I’ll try my best.

232
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:57,492
If the board considers me for this scholarship,

233
00:11:58,173 --> 00:11:59,543
I’ll give my all to deserve this opportunity.

234
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,786
Good.

235
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:04,650
We’ll find out in the next four months

236
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,613
the first person receiving this scholarship in our department.

237
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:08,906
Okay, sir.

238
00:12:22,737 --> 00:12:24,109
Good afternoon, Mr. Yoryak.

239
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:26,763
Today you have a checkup and physiotherapy with Dr. Nop.

240
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,563
What about the doctor who examined me the other day?

241
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:33,143
What is his name?

242
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:35,276
Oh, that’s Dr. Wandee.

243
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,152
Why?

244
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:38,574
Well…

245
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:41,590
We changed back to Dr. Nop for you.

246
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,712
We apologize that we changed your doctor at the last minute last time.

247
00:12:44,712 --> 00:12:45,544
Uh…

248
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:48,316
I don’t think you need to change my doctor.

249
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:51,389
That doctor seems okay.

250
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:54,243
But Dr. Wandee is not available at the moment.

251
00:12:54,243 --> 00:12:55,486
He’s in a meeting.

252
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:59,750
If you don’t want to wait, Dr. Nop is ready to examine you right now.

253
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,579
But I’m not ready.

254
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:03,713
I will come back later then.

255
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,355
Come have a word with me.

256
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:11,972
Let go of me.

257
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:13,616
Dr. Ter, let go of me.

258
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,126
Dr. Ter, let go of me.

259
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:19,944
What else do you want?

260
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:21,972
I think I have made it clear.

261
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:23,998
If you’re angry because I rejected you,

262
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:25,096
I’m sorry.

263
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:27,356
I know that you are upset.

264
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:29,337
I’m too upset.

265
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:31,866
I’m not upset at all.

266
00:13:32,242 --> 00:13:33,077
I’m all fine.

267
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,721
Last night, the moment I walked away from you,

268
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:37,517
I counted 5

269
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:38,576
4

270
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,849
3

271
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:40,846
2

272
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:43,220
Everything was erased.

273
00:13:48,544 --> 00:13:49,881
We’ve known each other for so long.

274
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,963
I know that you are not the person you claim to be now.

275
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:57,579
You don’t really know me.

276
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,326
Same as I just realized

277
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,592
I don’t know you at all.

278
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:04,367
We don’t need to have a fight like this.

279
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:06,281
Dee,

280
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:08,713
my focus right now is on the scholarship.

281
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:11,245
When I complete the scholarship,

282
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:13,631
let’s talk about this again.

283
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:16,926
About what?

284
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,226
About your feelings for me.

285
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,280
If you really have feelings for me,

286
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:28,101
give up that scholarship and let me have it.

287
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:32,038
Please do me this favor.

288
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:40,973
But the feelings I had for you never had any conditions.

289
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:46,698
I think we should end things between us right here.

290
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:48,560
It’s too damn tiring.

291
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,136
As for the scholarship,

292
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:52,407
who will receive it?

293
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:55,154
Let the board decide.

294
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,008
I’ll be your compatible opponent.

295
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:02,995
I won’t pull a punch, Senior Ter.

296
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:05,125
Is this how you want it?

297
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:10,865
Challenge accepted.

298
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:28,154
Does it still hurt?

299
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:34,742
I thought you requested to change doctors.

300
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:38,120
I don’t want to be too demanding with my sponsor.

301
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:40,177
I see.

302
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,173
Overall, your condition has greatly improved.

303
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:47,733
Probably last night…

304
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:49,543
I found the best cure.

305
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,017
Please don’t speak dirty in this room.

306
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:55,461
Just kidding.

307
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,330
I want you to relax.

308
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:05,477
My focus right now is on the scholarship.

309
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:08,717
When I complete the scholarship,

310
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:11,024
let’s talk about this again.

311
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:15,877
But the feelings I had for you never had any conditions.

312
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,753
This pen looks nice.

313
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:41,374
What’s up with you?

314
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:44,671
Nothing. I just like this pen.

315
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:51,598
I’ve got your next appointment booked, sir.

316
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:54,306
Okay.

317
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:28,392
Moo~

318
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,403
This is how you exercise with the right methods.

319
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:35,487
Let’s utilize sports science to make our lives healthier.

320
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:37,350
Cut.

321
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:39,951
How was it?

322
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:44,995
Not bad at all.

323
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,061
You said all the words in the scripts precisely.

324
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,592
It doesn’t look too silly, does it?

325
00:17:50,012 --> 00:17:50,969
Not at all.

326
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,515
With this video together with the paper I finished for you, this subject is good to go.

327
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,184
Sure?

328
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:56,744
Sure.

329
00:17:58,866 --> 00:17:59,819
That’s a relief.

330
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:01,323
I want to graduate already.

331
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:03,041
I don’t want to be a grandpa senior here.

332
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:05,429
Come here.

333
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:10,208
Come with me. I’ll help clean your face.

334
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,446
Is it sticky?

335
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:16,928
A bit.

336
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:27,890
Taem.

337
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,527
Hm?

338
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:31,653
You are a great help to me.

339
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,787
If there’s anything I can do to help you,

340
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:35,987
let me know.

341
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:37,973
Free of charge?

342
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:38,756
Yes.

343
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:40,731
Great. Be prepared then.

344
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:41,896
I’m gonna have several favors to ask from you.

345
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:42,891
This girl.

346
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,709
You don’t hesitate a bit to take this opportunity, huh?

347
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:46,987
Absolutely not.

348
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,421
You are a strong woman.

349
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:54,910
I never saw you cry or be dramatic even once.

350
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:57,545
Why would I cry?

351
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,368
Crying is tiring.

352
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:03,410
Seriously, I’m just like everyone else.

353
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:05,674
Nobody can be strong all the time.

354
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:08,458
Everyone has vulnerabilities that can trigger them.

355
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,003
Fighto!

356
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:35,020
I like you.

357
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:40,171
But I like you as a brother.

358
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,833
You are a very nice guy.

359
00:19:57,849 --> 00:19:59,264
But you are too vanilla for me.

360
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:08,161
I’m not vanilla, darn it!

361
00:20:41,563 --> 00:20:44,602
[Plakao: Don’t be too wild. You have to get up to work tomorrow.]

362
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,867
[I know. Are you my friend or my old man?]

363
00:20:58,085 --> 00:20:59,134
May we cling glasses with you?

364
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:03,737
Sure.

365
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:09,012
What’s your name?

366
00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:10,301
I’m Mac.

367
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,604
And that’s Aun.

368
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:15,041
My name is Wandee.

369
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,428
Really?

370
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:17,855
You are cute.

371
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:19,176
But your name is cuter.

372
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:21,937
Really?

373
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:25,603
How about we go bottoms up?

374
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:36,532
Excuse me.

375
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:38,432
What do you do?

376
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,030
I’m a doctor.

377
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:41,759
Where do you work?

378
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,174
At a hospital.

379
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,202
Don’t doctors have hospitals as their workplace?

380
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:51,443
You’re right.

381
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:54,587
Here you go.

382
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,818
Let’s do bottoms up for this round too.

383
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:23,971
Get off me.

384
00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:25,329
Come on.

385
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,096
He’s such a lightweight.

386
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:29,808
Just a few rounds and he’s already out.

387
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,943
Totally.

388
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:34,873
Have you told the chat group to be ready to watch some good stuff tonight?

389
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:38,688
All done. Many people have already transferred money to see it.

390
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:42,260
Let’s go.

391
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:43,641
I’m not going.

392
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:46,563
I’m not going!

393
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:48,382
He said he wasn’t going, didn’t he?

394
00:22:58,911 --> 00:22:59,502
Let’s go.

395
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:00,920
I’m not going.

396
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,782
He said he wasn’t going, didn’t he?

397
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,763
Who the hell are you?

398
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,663
This is none of your business.

399
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,141
Let go of my guy.

400
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,668
Don’t be funny.

401
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:14,881
He’s here alone.

402
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,295
5

403
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,337
4

404
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:33,146
Let’s get out of here.

405
00:23:42,124 --> 00:23:42,794
Doc.

406
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:44,546
I’m not going.

407
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:46,611
Go home.

408
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,354
Doc.

409
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:50,883
I’m not going.

410
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:31,688
My goodness.

411
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,228
It’s hot.

412
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:38,404
It’s hot.

413
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:39,918
Hey, Doc.

414
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:40,978
Take it easy, Doc.

415
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:48,049
Hot?

416
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:08,814
Didn’t you feel hot?

417
00:25:08,814 --> 00:25:09,453
Come on.

418
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,003
Alright.

419
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,505
Time to sleep.

420
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,569
Don’t go.

421
00:25:31,411 --> 00:25:33,415
Don’t leave me.

422
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,972
Stay with me, please.

423
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:45,402
Nobody can be strong all the time.

424
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,324
Stay with me, please.

425
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:50,243
Everyone has vulnerabilities that can trigger them.

426
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,857
Alright. I’m here.

427
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,880
Stay with me.

428
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:23,399
You’re okay now.

429
00:27:15,178 --> 00:27:16,643
[Eat this for a boost of energy.]

430
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:27,378
You know who prepared this, right?

431
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:38,030
1 2

432
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,517
1 2

433
00:27:40,281 --> 00:27:41,145
Good, 1 2

434
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:43,621
Straight.

435
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:44,938
Straight.

436
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,257
Good, 1 2

437
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:48,228
1 2

438
00:27:49,643 --> 00:27:50,197
Yak!

439
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:52,622
I don’t think this is right.

440
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:54,251
Sorry.

441
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:57,172
Let me get changed. I’ll be right with you.

442
00:27:57,374 --> 00:27:59,117
Do you think it’s that easy to attain a world championship title?

443
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:01,771
I told you to see a doctor, but you went MIA.

444
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:02,793
You didn’t show up at the evening’s training.

445
00:28:02,793 --> 00:28:03,855
I couldn’t get hold of you.

446
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:05,369
And you are late for this morning's training.

447
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:07,125
What is wrong with you?

448
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,809
Calm down, Yei.

449
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:11,108
I said sorry, didn’t I?

450
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:13,070
I won’t do it again.

451
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:14,337
Okay now?

452
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,520
Yak, hurry and get changed.

453
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:19,496
Relax.

454
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:20,814
Calm down.

455
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:27,775
I think Dr. Ter will seal this scholarship.
[In 4 months, you have the power to decide.]
[Who'll be the first orthopedic physician to win a scholarship abroad?]

456
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:28,620
Do you agree, guys?

457
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:30,470
Do you agree, Dr. Kwan?

458
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:33,893
Dr. Ter.

459
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:47,449
The judging panel has come to a decision.

460
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,490
In addition to the writing test scores,

461
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:54,027
you two will have four months to develop a campaign for our department.

462
00:28:55,185 --> 00:28:57,904
At the end, the employees in this hospital,

463
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:00,210
as well as the patients, will cast their votes.

464
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,885
This aspect will account for 70% of the total score.

465
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,926
It’s not too late to give up now, Dee.

466
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:15,614
At this rate, I would be a coward to back down.

467
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:27,178
Team Dr. Wandee. Yeah!

468
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:30,462
Here you are.

469
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:32,727
Yummy cakes for you.

470
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:35,306
Here you go.

471
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,197
Thank you.

472
00:29:36,737 --> 00:29:37,766
Here.

473
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,231
Thank you.

474
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:40,136
Look yum, eh?

475
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:43,343
Yes, but we didn’t order them.

476
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:45,465
You didn’t need to.

477
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:49,586
It’s on the house, a special service for our loyal customers.

478
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:52,163
Congrats on being a candidate to get the scholarship.

479
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:56,197
What? The news reached here incredibly fast.

480
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:02,534
I think a reporter might be a more suitable job for you than being a nurse.

481
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,986
I can’t help sharing this news with Golf.

482
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:08,093
And she told me to bring you to celebrate here right away.

483
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:09,836
Yes. Please do your best.

484
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:10,481
Thanks.

485
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:14,763
Don’t worry at all. You have my full support here.

486
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:16,420
Please enjoy your cakes.

487
00:30:16,532 --> 00:30:17,821
Thank you.

488
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:20,072
How lovely of her.

489
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:22,814
Let’s dig in.

490
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:25,608
Are you going home right away?

491
00:30:28,415 --> 00:30:30,523
No, I have to go meet someone.

492
00:30:36,832 --> 00:30:37,398
Go on.

493
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:38,226
Let’s celebrate.

494
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:02,049
Hello, Mrs. Monthakarn.

495
00:31:02,465 --> 00:31:04,802
Hey, Wandee.

496
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,366
What are all those things you're bringing?

497
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:09,965
I’ve got you a variety of things.

498
00:31:10,824 --> 00:31:11,672
You don’t need to.

499
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:14,232
When I crave something, I can order it via food apps myself.

500
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,545
What a beautiful way of saying thank you.

501
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:18,724
It’s my pleasure.

502
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:23,964
I miss you so much, Grandma.

503
00:31:23,964 --> 00:31:24,794
Give me a hug.

504
00:31:32,341 --> 00:31:35,340
Look, your shirt got dirty from hugging me.

505
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,288
It’s totally okay.

506
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:41,236
If it’s dirty, may I ask for a three times damage fee?

507
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:43,626
My little puppy.

508
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:04,804
How has it been for you lately?

509
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,260
Same old, same old.

510
00:32:08,832 --> 00:32:09,644
Are you sure?

511
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,906
Well, I’m facing some new challenges I’ve never faced before.

512
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:19,613
That sounds quite challenging.

513
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:24,931
I’m in love with this smile of yours the most in the world, you know.

514
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,891
I’m also in love with this stubborn nose of yours.

515
00:32:31,272 --> 00:32:32,711
Can I lay on your lap, Grandma?

516
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:35,098
Why not?

517
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:37,979
Go ahead.

518
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:47,411

519
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:48,309
Hm?

520
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:54,564
Do you think Dad and Mom up there will think of us at all?

521
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:57,565
Of course. I’m sure they do.

522
00:32:59,002 --> 00:32:59,946
Why do you ask?

523
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:01,584
Do you feel lonely being by yourself?

524
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:05,185
I’m not lonely. The work at the hospital is so busy.

525
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,332
Tell me honestly. Are you still single?

526
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:21,552
Come on, Grandma.

527
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:28,884
I’d like you to learn to live life. Find someone.

528
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:31,876
I don’t have time for that.

529
00:33:32,101 --> 00:33:33,546
I’ve got my patients

530
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:35,346
and also I have to be prepared for the scholarship test.

531
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:37,922
That’s true.

532
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:49,030
His punch seems really strong.

533
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:53,588
You watch boxing now?

534
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:56,822
Sometimes.

535
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:12,006
I think we need to audit the Student Union

536
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:14,037
and see if there are any discrepancies in their finances.

537
00:34:14,037 --> 00:34:16,385
This is also our Student Committee’s responsibility.

538
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:18,563
Let's assign tasks and form teams to conduct this audit.

539
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:19,569
Taem,

540
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:21,843
can I ask you to closely monitor this?

541
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,263
Sure, Ohm.

542
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:27,043
Tan, I asked you to get some info. How’s that going?

543
00:34:27,307 --> 00:34:28,363
Any updates?

544
00:34:29,363 --> 00:34:32,061
They’ll provide a summary report later.
[I’ve arrived.]

545
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:34,412
I leave that to you then.

546
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,286
Please excuse me a sec.

547
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,156
Here.

548
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,546
It’s done.

549
00:34:55,075 --> 00:34:57,346
The Student Committee meeting is not finished?

550
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,341
Um.

551
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,368
But we have a movie plan today.

552
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:02,989
It’s the movie that you chose.

553
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:07,086
I don’t think I can go with you now.

554

Can we watch it later?

555
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,479
I assure you I won’t bail again.

556
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:11,255
Okay?

557
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:12,768
Please, please.

558
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,628
You sure?

559
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,066
Sure.

560
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:19,656
I’m getting back in.

561
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:11,796
Are you messing with me, Doc?

562
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,643
Are you changing from a boxer to a homeless person?

563
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:42,278
Boxer guy, where are you headed? I can give you a ride.

564
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:49,363
Where do you want to go? I can take you there.

565
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:52,650
I don’t know.

566
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:55,172
I don’t know where I want to go.

567
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,030
I feel pity for the female lead.

568
00:37:09,363 --> 00:37:11,094
The male lead is such a red flag.

569
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:15,989
He may have his reasons.

570
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:19,359
It probably isn’t his intention to hurt her feelings.

571
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:26,888
You came to drink in my room.

572
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,281
Don’t you want to share with me what upset you?

573
00:37:37,596 --> 00:37:39,501
Hold on, I won’t ask now.

574
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,361
Let’s watch something else.

575

Doc.

Do you want to do it?

577
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:34,485
Ah,

578
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:36,186
I forgot.

579
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,270
You don’t have sex with the same guy.

580
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:42,431
I’m just a one-night stand.

Hey.

You want that?

Um.

00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:18,881
Well,

00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:22,577
what are the rules between us?

594
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,603
Simple.

595
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:30,523
We won’t intrude on each other’s private matters.

596
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,355
We meet up and have sex.

597
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,717
We can tell each other what we like and what we don’t like.

598
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:44,647
If one of us wants to try something new, the other party must give consent.

599
00:40:44,647 --> 00:40:45,282
Okay.

600

Sorry.

I want to keep my first kiss for the person I truly love.

Are you okay with that?

That…I’m not okay?

Why?

607
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:07,333
I mean you keep calling me something else instead of my name.

608
00:41:07,477 --> 00:41:08,261
I don’t like it.

609
00:41:08,693 --> 00:41:09,680
What do you want me to call you?

610
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,329
I do have a name.
