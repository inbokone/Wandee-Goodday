1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,640
I’ll be your compatible opponent.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,130
I won’t pull a punch, Senior Ter.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,740
So which security guard carried you to your room last night?

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,230
I didn’t really remember.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,060
How about we become friends with benefits?

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,620
What are the rules between us?

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,410
We won’t intrude on each other’s private matters.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,160
We meet up and have sex.

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,820
But you don’t allow me to kiss you, right?

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,420
Do you allow this?

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,400
Tired?

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,600
Still okay.

13
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,070
Hang in there.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:44,960
More?

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,000
What is this pendant’s shape?

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,460
Two Ys

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,900
Yor-Yak?

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,210
Yes.

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,400
A strange name, but cool.

20
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,520
Yoryak.

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,680
You have a nice word for me.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,830
The world is probably collapsing.

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,980
Don’t exaggerate.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,310
Why don’t you take a shower? In a rush?

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,400
Um.

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,130
I’d rather shower at my boxing gym.

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,290
I should get there fast or else Yei will scold me.

28
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,590
Yei?

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,940
Who is Yei?

30
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,000
It’s okay if you don’t want to tell me.

31
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,890
No worries. I’ll tell you.

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,720
He’s my big brother. His name is Oyei.

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,260
He always acts more like a father than a brother.

34
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,490
And when he coaches me, he’s as ferocious as a fierce dog.

35
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,700
If your brother is like your father,

36
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,090
you must be like your mother.

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,390
Maybe. I’m not sure.

38
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,600
I’m heading out now.

39
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,290
Yak.

40
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,110
Don’t forget this cap, you are the legendary AC guy.

41
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,490
Thanks for letting me serve you.

42
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,290
Please call me if you need my service again.

43
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,510
Of course, I will.

44
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,330
See you.

45
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,180
(Phadetseuk)

46
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,740
Yak.

47
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:23,900
Hm?

48
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,520
Where’s your necklace?

49
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,070
Necklace?

50
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,960
Do you wear necklaces now?

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,250
I never saw you wear one before.

52
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm giving it a try.

53
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,270
A guy gave it to you?

54
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,570
Yes.

55
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,890
I don’t know.

56
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,710
I probably left it somewhere.

57
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,570
You don’t know, or you don’t want us to know?

58
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,240
The one you slept with while I was in Chonburi?

59
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,760
How did you know?

60
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,060
I don’t know who he is,

61
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,330
but I could smell you got lucky.

62
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,260
Smart ass.

63
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,750
Are you a doctor or a dog exactly?

64
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,640
Yak is a sugar daddy.

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,890
He's so generous when dating. You also know that.

66
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,130
At which stage are you with the person you gave the necklace to?

67
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,450
I said I didn’t know where I left it.

68
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,820
Really?

69
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,230
Alright.

70
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,120
I gave it to someone.

71
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,060
But we’re not an item.

72
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,360
Just a fuck buddy.

73
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,260
Fuck buddy?

74
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,390
What’s so funny?

75
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,430
I like that, ‘fuck buddy’.

76
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,070
It sounds romantic.

77
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,480
At least you consider that person your buddy.

78
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,620
Right?

79
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,600
Buddy.

80
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,110
Buddy!

81
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,320
Buddy. I see.

82
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,600
Are you in a relationship with that guy?

83
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,880
Or is it just casual sex?

84
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,720
Casual, of course.

85
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,980
I'm not ready for any kind of relationship with anyone now.

86
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,780
It's exhausting.

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,510
Really?

88
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,860
But it seems like more than just a one-night stand.

89
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,450
He even gave you this necklace.

90
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,640
Just for pleasure, I think.

91
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,610
So you hang out a lot

92
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,940
with the same person

93
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,440
not changing partners, right?

94
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,090
Hey, Kao. I’m not your patient.

95
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,980
Want to be one? Be my guest.

96
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,810
No, I'm not changing partners.

97
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,220
I don’t sleep around.

98
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,830
So it developed from a one-night stand to friends with benefits.

99
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,550
I’m not saying it's a bad thing. It's totally normal.

100
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,820
I have many patients doing this.

101
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:47,760
But...

102
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,290
be careful.

103
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,900
Don't

104
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,480
watch too many romantic movies

105
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,940
or else you might start expecting

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,940
that it could develop into a serious relationship.

107
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,110
Although there's a 27% chance of that happening.

108
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,520
Okay.

109
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,480
Though Wandee means a good day,

110
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,480
I don’t always think things are good and rosy.

111
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,820
I can distinguish between love, relationship,

112
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,830
or just pleasure.

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,900
Clear?

114
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,280
I think you have a good chance of getting this scholarship.

115
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,190
Dr. Wandee.

116
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,120
Dr. Plakao.

117
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,290
Hi.

118
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,730
Aren't we headed to the men's room? Let's go.

119
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,130
Come on.

120
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,350
This is such a great acting talent

121
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,720
from this year’s Oscar winner, Dr. Wandee.

122
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,600
He smiles like he’s strong,

123
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,010
but his heart is completely shattered.

124
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,350
Are you having so much fun?

125
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,720
Dr. Wandee is really cute.

126
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,190
His skin is smooth and clear like glass.

127
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,540
If he had chosen dermatology, he would have done so well in that field.

128
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,990
I agree.

129
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,120
But I heard he would go to further his studies in orthopedics like you.

130
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,720
I don’t know about that.

131
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,170
Where did you hear it from?

132
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,660
Just some staff chitchatting.

133
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:42,750
I see.

134
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,830
Dr. Ter, thank you for the souvenir.

135
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:50,990
Do you like it?

136
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,720
I do.

137
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,870
I like both the gift and the giver.

138
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,910
They look good together, unlike…

139
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,840
Unlike what, Ood?

140
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,080
Unlike what Nurse Noinong told us.

141
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,550
I’m sorry.

142
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,010
I haven’t been here for the past few days.

143
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,730
I’ve been in intense training.

144
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,550
I understand. Don’t feel bad about it.

145
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,420
We can meet when we’re both free.

146
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,430
I’ve been quite busy lately too,

147
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,160
dealing with patient cases and hitting the books.

148
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,050
Not to mention all those campaign meetings.

149
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,270
What brings you here today though?

150
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,120
Got free time?

151
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,780
At first, I didn’t.

152
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,460
But after...

153
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,120
hearing this voice, I couldn’t resist not coming here.

154
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,030
(You must’ve been busy. When you’re free, come meet me too.)

155
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,000
Look, someone is missing me.

156
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,630
No, I’m not.

157
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,230
I just play along with your game.

158
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,910
Someone sent me this seductive clip when I lost touch with him.

159
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Not seductive.

160
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,630
I just wanted to show I was busy training hard.

161
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,940
Really?

162
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,750
If you miss me, just say “I miss you.”

163
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,050
That’s simple.

164
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,600
Say it.

165
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,280
Hey.

166
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,680
The light bulb.

167
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,920
You haven’t changed it.

168
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Yoryak, don’t change the subject.

169
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,220
Hey, it’s not good to leave it like that.

170
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,480
Let me help change it for you.

171
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,040
“I miss you.” Say it.

172
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,370
I miss you.

173
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,530
Happy now?

174
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,650
I won.

175
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,800
You like to win that much, huh?

176
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,680
Yes.

177
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,300
That’s my bad habit.

178
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,510
Winning over someone makes me feel sexy.

179
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,320
Really, Doctor?

180
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,400
Here.

181
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,810
Time to change the light bulb.

182
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,330
Gosh. You like to dictate too.

183
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,670
Here.

184
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,130
Let’s see if it will light up.

185
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,670
Woah.

186
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,890
You are so talented.

187
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,090
Highly skilled.

188
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,330
Surely.

189
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,680
That’s surely fake.

190
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,260
You actually can change that yourself, right?

191
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,730
I’m not sure.

192
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,990
What’re you up to, Cher?

193
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,360
You seem quite serious.

194
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,720
I’m working on the financial stuff.

195
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,500
There are so many numbers that I’m frowning without realizing.

196
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,050
Can I assist you with anything?

197
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,130
Is Oyei around?

198
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,160
I think he’s out running an errand.

199
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,410
What’s up?

200
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,280
Well, my father is sick.

201
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,970
I want to ask Oyei if I can get an advance payment.

202
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,320
I don’t think there should be any problem with that.

203
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,520
This is not something Oyei doesn’t allow.

204
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,860
I’ll let him know when he’s back.

205
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,600
Thanks a lot, Cher.

206
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,370
Harder.

207
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,760
Harder, Yei.

208
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,680
Harder?

209
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Harder.

210
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,620
Harder?

211
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,400
Harder.

212
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,860
Harder!

213
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,800
Is that hard enough?

214
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,960
You pervy man.

215
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,740
Hey, people might see us.

216
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,120
My beau is cute.

217
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,810
Why?

218
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,120
It’s embarrassing.

219
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,410
It’s not. I own this place. What to be afraid of?

220
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,300
What to be afraid of?

221
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,940
Here.

222
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,210
Thank you.

223
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,600
Hey.

224
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,730
Jo came to talk to you about advance payment, right?

225
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,060
Yes. I must give it to him.

226
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,660
His father is sick.

227
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,090
Will there be enough left to pay off the debts?

228
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,930
During the Covid shutdown,

229
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,200
our boxers couldn’t participate in any matches.

230
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,510
You had to take out a loan to cover the expenses.

231
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,400
Come on.

232
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,710
That matter was sorted out a long time ago.

233
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,600
Don’t worry about it.

234
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,600
I’ve already managed everything. There should be no problem.

235
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,270
Alright, Mr. Have-Everything-Managed.

236
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,380
How about this?

237
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,840
If we don’t have enough money this month,

238
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,920
why don’t we borrow from my mother?

239
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,450
No, I don’t want to.

240
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,970
I already got the gold shop lady’s son to be mine

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,890
and even have him work for my gym.

242
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,610
I feel bad enough.

243
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,320
I don’t want to impose on her any more than I already do.

244
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,200
Then If anyone shows interest in our boxing courses,

245
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,530
I’ll sell them all.

246
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,520
All the boxers in our gym must become trainers and must not refuse.

247
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,910
You must help me as well.

248
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,510
Understood?

249
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,440
Okay.

250
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,520
If anyone dares to object Madam Cher,

251
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,520
they’ll have to deal with Mr. Oyei.

252
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,060
Stop it.

253
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,090
I’m serious about what I said.

254
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,860
You have given me your word.

255
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,930
You must not break it.

256
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,100
Understood?

257
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,980
Don’t do this, Cher.

258
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,070
Why?

259
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,210
Did I hurt you?

260
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,550
No.

261
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,930
You look so damn cute.

262
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,040
Yei.

263
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,820
Peekaboo!

264
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,410
Where is Namphu the strong boy?

265
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,070
That’s me, I’m Namphu the strong boy.

266
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,360
Let me see if you’re really strong or not.

267
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,660
Can I check?

268
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,550
Yes.

269
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,550
You are indeed a strong boy.

270
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,670
I told you I’m strong.

271
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,640
You deserve a reward for being this strong.

272
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,780
What will I get?

273
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,450
Here they are.

274
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,520
Tada!

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,350
Which one do you like?

276
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,750
I like this one.

277
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,170
Thank you so much, Dr. Wandee.

278
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,930
You’re welcome.

279
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,950
When my son told me he was in pain,

280
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,620
I didn't know what to do.

281
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,960
I tried not to cry in front of him.

282
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
You are a very strong mother.

283
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,500
No wonder Namphu is so optimistic.

284
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,270
The cancer has spread to his spine.

285
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,150
Is there any chance for him to recover

286
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,250
and have a normal life like other kids?

287
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,670
We will do our best, ma’am.

288
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:27,120
Even the best can’t make my son the same again.

289
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,640
Ma’am.

290
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,330
It’s always harder to repair than to rebuild.

291
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,760
But I will do everything I can

292
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,280
to help him stand again with his own strength,

293
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,660
and minimize his dependence on others.

294
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,700
If he can do that,

295
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,310
he will have a sense of pride in himself

296
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,520
and not lose his self-worth.

297
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,290
Dr. Apichart,

298
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,850
our future premier orthopedic center

299
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,800
will have a more advanced osteosarcoma department

300
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,700
equipped with more cutting-edge equipment, right?

301
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,250
Yes.

302
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,090
But all those advanced medical devices may be ineffective

303
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,910
if we don’t have skilled enough physicians.

304
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,790
What’s up?

305
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,640
Hi there.

306
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,740
I’m at my uni, not training at the gym.

307
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,640
So, no exclusive video clip for you today.

308
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,030
I told you, didn’t I?

309
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,030
Just say “I miss you” when you miss me.

310
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,090
Who’s missing you? Don’t be funny.

311
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,030
Hold on, Doc.

312
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,820
What’s going on? Your eyes look swollen.

313
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,020
Did you cry?

314
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,870
What happened?

315
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,160
Nothing.

316
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,580
I’m fine.

317
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,080
I’m just letting my thoughts wander.

318
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,850
Loaded tasks?

319
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,340
A bit.

320
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,990
Are you feeling very tired?

321
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,090
It feels so nice to have someone ask if you’re tired when you are.

322
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,820
Doc, seriously, are you okay?

323
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,740
I’m okay.

324
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,100
Nothing to be worried about.

325
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,260
Anyway, are you coming to my place tonight?

326
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,590
I’m waiting for you to ask.

327
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,340
Well then, please wait for your dinner from this delivery rider.

328
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,860
I’ll be waiting.

329
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,840
Okay.

330
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,220
Dr. Wandee.

331
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,360
Yes?

332
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,990
Some people want to start a war.

333
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:47,570
Rumor has it that he confessed and got rejected outright.

334
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,570
What’s wrong with Dr. Wandee?

335
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,450
He got rejected. He transitioned into a rival.

336
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,180
Look at him now.

337
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,720
He’s acting disrespectfully to his own senior.

338
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,490
You all seem to enjoy trash-talking.

339
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,010
How about some defamation lawsuits?

340
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,280
Dr. Wandee.

341
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,300
Hey, why stop now?

342
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,110
Ah, I get it. You’re saving your voice for defending in court.

343
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,680
What? Are you going to sue me?

344
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,300
On what grounds?

345
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,300
Everything I said is true.

346
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,050
Do you have evidence?

347
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,750
If you don’t, that’s a groundless rumor.

348
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,340
That’s the evidence.

349
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,550
What are you talking about?

350
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,790
Hi, Dr. Ter.

351
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,620
We’re talking about what people are saying about Dr. Wandee.

352
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,200
They say he applied for this scholarship

353
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,810
because he confessed to you and was rejected at a restaurant.

354
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,160
What is this about?

355
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,310
Where did you hear that rumor from?

356
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,380
It’s not a rumor since it’s not groundless.

357
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,420
But this can be seen from miles away how Dr. Wandee thinks about you.

358
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,640
What do I think about him?

359
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,360
I don’t think about him at all.

360
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,940
Are you sure?

361
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,560
I’m sure.

362
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,160
And also…

363
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,780
Read my lips.

364
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,510
I’m already seeing someone.

365
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,120
That can’t be real.

366
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,770
It’s real.

367
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,210
Right, guys?

368
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,640
Yes.

369
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,490
Yes.

370
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,700
Dr. Wandee is already seeing someone.

371
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,890
It’s the owner of the necklace on his neck.

372
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,730
Now stop talking about me.

373
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,200
You should spend this time doing your work and taking care of patients.

374
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,020
Dee.

375
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,800
Dee!

376
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,910
Where are you going?

377
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,440
Dee.

378
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,280
Dee!

379
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:45,270
Dee, wait.

380
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,480
Dee.

381
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,220
I have no involvement in that.

382
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,370
Thanks for telling me.

383
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,270
I knew you wouldn’t do something like that.

384
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,400
But Nurse Noinong, your head supporter,

385
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
I think this is going too far.

386
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,300
I’m starting my campaign soon.

387
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,640
Going forward, let’s play by the rules.

388
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,899
They're using rumors to discredit you.

389
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,570
Are we still stuck in the politics of the '80s?

390
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,650
What an old trick.

391
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,470
I know, right?

392
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,250
Anyway, this could seriously affect the votes for the scholarship.

393
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,060
I’m not shaken by it.

394
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,050
It’s still a long way before the vote day.

395
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,790
What will you do now?

396
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,070
You made them believe you're seeing someone.

397
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,210
Where will you find a guy to be your date now?

398
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,850
Do you already have someone in mind?

399
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,670
No.

400
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
But I can find someone to play that role.

401
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,900
Cheers.

402
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,350
Yak.

403
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,680
How about we pretend to be in a relationship for four months?

404
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,220
Like announcing it to the public?

405
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,390
Can we?

406
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,880
Please, do me this little favor.

407
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,880
It’s necessary for me.

408
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,670
I think...

409
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,510
we should revisit what's between us.

410
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,870
We agreed to be friends with benefits

411
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,360
because we didn't want a relationship, right?

412
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,300
Um.

413
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,530
But here you're asking me to be in a fake relationship with you?

414
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,740
Correct. 10 points to you.

415
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,680
Take back your damn test paper.

416
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,300
I don’t want to do it anymore.

417
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,300
Hey, why?

418
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,280
Come on, Yak. Please help me.

419
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,200
It’s not much to ask.

420
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,610
Just four months. It’s not that long.

421
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,360
But this is too much to ask from me.

422
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,290
I'm a hopeful world championship boxer.

423
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,370
How can I announce to the public that I’m dating…

424
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,790
dating a guy? I don’t think that’s good for me.

425
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,340
But this is a new era.

426
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,090
No one really cares about this kind of thing.

427
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,150
But I care.

428
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,820
I think I should drop out of this.

429
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,420
Hey,

430
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,680
Yak.

431
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,770
Yak!

432
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,540
Yak.

433
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,610
Come on, Yak.

434
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,160
It’s just to let people in my hospital know.

435
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,940
Other people won’t find out. I can assure you that.

436
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,930
But you just said it yourself.

437
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,700
We are in this era.

438
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,520
It’s not possible, seriously.

439
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,370
Once it’s out there, you cannot control it.

440
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,490
Once it’s released to the public, you can never truly contain it.

441
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,570
But I said I can assure you, didn’t I?

442
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,120
Doc.

443
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,700
We see each other because we want to have fun, don’t we?

444
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,170
But this isn't fun anymore for me.

445
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,960
Let’s put an end to it here.

446
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,110
Yak.

447
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,030
Yak!

448
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,260
Yoryak!

449
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,840
Why did you stop, Jo?

450
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,640
I’m exhausted.

451
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,820
I think I’ve skipped more than a thousand times already.

452
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,270
Let me take a break.

453
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,440
Alright. Rest if you want.

454
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,560
But you must try to shed some weight.

455
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,480
You were almost over the weight limit when you last weighed in.

456
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,040
You know?

457
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,530
Got it.

458
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:57,810
Hi.

459
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,340
Are you looking for someone?

460
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,230
I’m here to see Yoryak.

461
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,450
Is he here?

462
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,560
Hey, Doc.

463
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,880
Don’t you think you're crossing a line here?

464
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,050
You came to find me at my gym?

465
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,760
I told you I didn’t want to do that.

466
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,350
I understand that you don’t want to do it.

467
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,830
But if you don’t help me,

468
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,410
I’m going to lose this scholarship.

469
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,760
This scholarship is really important to me.

470
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,230
If I don’t get it,

471
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,330
I don’t know if I'll ever have enough money to study abroad in this lifetime.

472
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,810
Cut the drama.

473
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,750
Doctors are rich.

474
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,120
Don’t use money as your reason.

475
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,610
How about this?

476
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:39,130
I pay you.

477
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,010
How much do you want? Just say the number.

478
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,640
I’ll transfer to your account right away.

479
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,530
What for?

480
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,640
I’m not in need of money.

481
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,630
Go hire someone else.

482
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,600
Why are you going after me?

483
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,930
Please.

484
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,850
Please.

485
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,940
Just leave.

486
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,650
Yak!

487
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
(Open Now, Private Training 10 sessions/month only ฿4,500!)
(6 courses, 6 months, no fixing time ฿25,000)

488
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,130
What? Six courses!

489
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,840
Yes, on one little condition.

490
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,240
You’ll get it.

491
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,580
Are you going to teach him or not?

492
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,230
No.

493
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,780
If he really wants to have a boxing class here,

494
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,230
let other guys teach him.

495
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,770
Then I think I’ll have to cancel my courses.

496
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,970
Please wait a bit.

497
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,910
People must not give up or give in on hopes too easily!

498
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:36,920
Come on, Yak!

499
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,370
Stop it. I’m not gonna teach him and that’s that.

500
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,850
Hello, Cher.

501
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,710
Yak is adamant with his decision.

502
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,440
You must not let him.

503
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,890
You already gave me your word.

504
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,890
(You would do everything to help me sell my courses.)

505
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,720
But Yak completely refused. How could I make him?

506
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,770
That’s your problem.

507
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,030
I’m going back to my home.

508
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,090
Don’t come get me.

509
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,640
Hey, Cher.

510
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,770
Please wait a bit more, Doctor.

511
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:10,530
I guarantee that you will have Yoryak as your personal trainer.

512
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,200
I promise that when you are here tomorrow,

513
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,940
you’ll get to see Yoryak definitely.

514
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,130
Definitely?

515
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,540
Yes, trust me.

516
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,550
I’ll wait for your sake then.

517
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,910
Would it be possible to pay for the course fee now?

518
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,030
Sure.

519
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,410
Payment done!

520
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,520
Yak.

521
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,840
Let’s settle this in the Phadetseuk family way.

522
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,860
If you defeat me,

523
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,130
you don’t have to teach Dr. Wandee.

524
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,610
But if you lose to me,

525
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,010
you must teach him.

526
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,420
Deal?

527
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:07,910
Deal.

528
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,170
Six courses are at stake!

529
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,870
Or else I’ll go back to my home.

530
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,830
Move toward him.

531
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,050
Go. Move.

532
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,770
You’ve got this, Yei.

533
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,880
Come on, Yei!

534
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,670
For the six courses!

535
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,080
Here.

536
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,220
Thank you, Trainer.

537
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,870
Please give me advice.

538
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,050
Wow.

539
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,900
Do you want me to wear this for the class?

540
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:24,920
Yes.

541
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,640
Cher would like you to post a picture of yourself wearing it

542
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,730
and tag Phadetseuk Boxing Club in your post.

543
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,730
Will do.

544
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,380
Don’t smile at me.

545
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,930
Let me make it clear here.

546
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,360
Me accepting to be your trainer

547
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,960
has nothing to do with that request of yours.

548
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,050
I haven’t said a thing about it.

549
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,560
Be serious when learning.

550
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,230
You’re quite strict,

551
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,270
Mr. Trainer Yoryak.

552
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,630
You’ll see a stricter me soon.

553
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,000
Baby, let me give it to you

554
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:07,630
Baby, I assure you it won’t be dull

555
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,990
It won’t hurt you at all, ahh

556
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,280
Baby, let me guarantee

557
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,000
Baby, once you try it, you’ll get down on your knees

558
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,620
Begging to be with me

559
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,080
I never thought boxing training could be this tiring.

560
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,580
You don’t have the basics.

561
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,460
As you learn, your body’s fitness can improve.

562
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,830
That’s it for today.

563
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,450
Hey. Don’t go yet.

564
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,790
What more do you want?

565
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,660
It’s been days that you haven’t come to watch a series at my place.

566
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,320
Stop it.

567
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,450
Stop seducing me.

568
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,030
It’s over between us.

569
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,290
Then tell me.

570
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,650
What do I need to do to get you to help me?

571
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,460
I’ll agree to be your fake boyfriend,

572
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,440
only if within the next five minutes,

573
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,610
you can land a punch on me.

574
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,010
Just one punch?

575
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,450
You’re giving me too much edge.

576
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,010
Yak!

577
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,670
What’re you doing? I’m right here.

578
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,080
I’m serious this time.

579
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,350
Now you can stop asking me to be your fake boyfriend.

580
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:06,900
Doc.

581
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,680
What’s wrong?

582
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,500
Nothing.

583
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,320
I’m just exhausted.

584
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,480
What do you want now?

585
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:23,450
Hold on.

586
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,090
Where are you taking me to?

587
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,080
(9 Wonton Noodles)

588
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Thank you.

589
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,490
Get a new one if you want to have it too.

590
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,080
Don’t stare at me.

591
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,130
I can’t fully enjoy my food.

592
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,220
No, I don’t want to eat it.

593
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,770
Don’t tell me you never had this?

594
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,680
Are you crazy? How could I never have this simple dish?

595
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,220
I’m just wondering why you keep me company.

596
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,130
This is really delicious.

597
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,000
It’s so so good.

598
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,730
Alright. I can have a bite.

599
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,820
I was trying to be strict with my IF program.

600
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,460
Have this.

601
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,970
You exercised a lot earlier.

602
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,210
Eat this. You need to reach the necessary protein level.

603
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,540
Wow. It’s yummy.

604
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,250
You said you had it before.

605
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,340
That was long ago.

606
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,140
What an excuse artist.

607
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,070
Go ahead. Eat it with me.

608
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,360
This is nice.

609
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:28,860
Doc.

610
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,330
Why did you accept my challenge?

611
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,330
Weren’t you scared of getting hit in the face?

612
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:34,970
I wasn’t scared.

613
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,370
I knew you would never hurt me.

614
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:38,990
That's confidence.

615
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,680
Yes.

616
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,200
Doc.

617
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:45,220
Hm?

618
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,330
Can I ask?

619
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,710
About this fake relationship,

620
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,310
why does it have to be me?

621
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,110
That's probably because you never ignored me.

622
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,950
What do you mean?

623
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,640
That night.

624
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
When I was so drunk sitting by the trash.

625
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,680
You could have easily left me there alone.

626
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,090
But you didn’t.

627
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,220
Instead, you carried me on your back to my condo.

628
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,810
And then there was that other night

629
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,810
when some bad guys got me drunk.

630
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,830
Someone was there to save me.

631
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,980
Without that person’s embrace that night,

632
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
I couldn’t imagine what would have happened to me.

633
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,810
Also that person was so kind that he woke up early and made me breakfast.

634
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,430
Though the look of it hardly qualified as breakfast.

635
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,590
How did you know it was me?

636
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,850
Have you heard of a gadget called CCTV on this planet?

637
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:00,940
What?

638
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,750
Do you have CCTV installed in your room?

639
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,220
Are you nuts?

640
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,300
It’s the Condo’s CCTV.

641
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,330
That’s a relief.

642
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,060
So,

643
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,210
if I were to look for someone to be my fake boyfriend,

644
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,640
to shut up those mean colleagues who like to trash-talk me–

645
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,810
insulting me, saying I compete for the scholarship

646
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,090
to disrespect a senior after being rejected–

647
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,100
I couldn’t think of anyone else but you.

648
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,970
Doc.

649
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,020
I…

650
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,580
I understand.

651
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,950
Actually, this matter doesn’t really concern you.

652
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,190
I shouldn’t drag you into it.

653
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,040
Can you forget about it?

654
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,220
I’ll find a way to deal with it somehow.

655
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:08,960
Doc.

656
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,890
What are you doing?

657
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,490
You successfully landed a punch on me.

658
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,350
Let’s be fake boyfriends.

659
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,760
Wow, fireworks.

660
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,690
It’s not festival time, how come there are fireworks?

661
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,700
I don’t know either. Probably a new mall has just opened.

662
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,980
Never mind.

663
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,420
Isn’t it beautiful?

664
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:56,900
Um.

665
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,680
Four months, right?

666
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,090
Yes, four months.

667
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,730
It’s around the same time as my world championship fight.

668
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:15,600
If I can make it to the finals.

669
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,820
I’m sure you will reach the finals.

670
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,070
We both have our own goals to achieve.

671
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,550
Mr. Soon-To-Be World Champion Boxer.

672
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,580
Go get it too.

673
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
Soon-To-Be Scholarship Winner Doctor.

674
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,400
I can’t believe him.

675
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,950
He confessed to his crush but got rejected

676
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,660
so he decided to challenge that crush without any respect for seniority.

677
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,340
Where did you hear that from?

678
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,960
When he confessed,

679
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,610
Noinong saw him.

680
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,050
He told me every little detail.

681
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,370
What’s funny is that

682
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,550
when he got exposed, he made up a story about dating someone.

683
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,300
I couldn’t believe he would go this far.

684
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,030
That’s not what happened, Nurse Oud.

685
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,240
Come on, Dr. Ter. Stop protecting him.

686
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,870
He’s a disrespectful person.

687
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,030
Nurse Oud.

688
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,080
How could we vote for this kind of person to get the scholarship?

689
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:57,930
Right?

690
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:58,570
Right.

691
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,900
It must be you, Dr. Ter.

692
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,420
You have all the qualities. You’re kind.

693
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,530
You deserve the scholarship.

694
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,380
Am I right?

695
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,399
Yes.

696
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,530
You can compliment someone without tearing down others, you know?

697
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,080
What I said is 1000% true, isn’t it?

698
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,540
Well, we’ll find out what is true soon, I guess.

699
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,950
Yoryak Phadetseuk!

700
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,510
Doc.

701
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,400
Yak.

702
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,300
Take this.

703
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:58,940
Do you like it?

704
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:17,386
You’re good at this.

705
00:45:17,662 --> 00:45:19,226
Let’s make our pretense seem as real as possible,

706
00:45:19,671 --> 00:45:20,622
darling.

707
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,462
Did you see Dr. Ter’s face?

708
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,622
It was so damn satisfying.

709
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:38,133
He was giving a buttface.

710
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,324
And those nurses too.

711
00:45:41,368 --> 00:45:42,168
They were all flabbergasted.

712
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:51,057
It’s time to celebrate our first step of being fake boyfriends.

713
00:45:51,262 --> 00:45:53,333
I’ll show you my cooking skills.

714
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,128
You can cook?

715
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,862
I’m a student of Chef Yu.

716
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,720
Chef Yu?

717
00:46:00,773 --> 00:46:03,857
Yu eat it if you can. If you can't,  that's a Yu problem!

718
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,346
Is this how you like to play?

719
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,515
Yak.

720
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,311
Do you really know how to do that?

721
00:46:18,488 --> 00:46:19,164
Yes.

722
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,017
Let me do it for you.

723
00:46:22,195 --> 00:46:22,995
No.

724
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:24,328
I want to do it.

725
00:46:24,444 --> 00:46:25,546
Let me do it.

726
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:27,075
No. You’re not good at doing it.

727
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,546
Let me try first.

728
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,395
Look.

729
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:37,191
You need to do it like this.

730
00:46:39,928 --> 00:46:41,920
Put the chili paste in the pan, only half of that.

731
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,995
Stir it to release the fragrance, then pork.

732
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,062
It’s burning.

733
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,315
No, it’s not.

734
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:07,240
Stay out of it.

735
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,577
Put the mortar away.

736
00:47:08,613 --> 00:47:10,248
Then go clear those.

737
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,595
It looks good.

738
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:23,831
But…

739
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,217
are you sure it’s edible?

740
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,791
Of course.

741
00:47:29,671 --> 00:47:30,293
Look.

742
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,480
Wow.

743
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,746
So delicious.

744
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:45,706
Really?

745
00:47:47,662 --> 00:47:48,533
It’s that good?

746
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,524
It doesn’t look like it.

747
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,408
In what universe is this considered delicious?

748
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,364
Isn’t it good?

749
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,662
It’s overly salty, Doc.

750
00:48:15,697 --> 00:48:18,702
This could be lethal for people with kidney problems, you know.

751
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,600
I think I went a little overboard with the salt.

752
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,777
Give me water.

753
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,364
Sorry.

754
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,177
Go learn cooking again.

755
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,764
Forget Chef U and find a new teacher.

756
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:38,648
But you said it was good.

757
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:40,115
You are a big fan of salty food, right?

758
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:41,342
No, I’m good.

759
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:41,911
No, you’re not.

760
00:48:41,937 --> 00:48:43,333
Another bite, come on.

761
00:48:43,368 --> 00:48:44,168
I’m done.

762
00:48:44,204 --> 00:48:44,613
Just a small bite.

763
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:45,573
It’s big.

764
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:46,293
It’s too big.

765
00:48:46,328 --> 00:48:47,920
You already experienced a bigger bite.

766
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,511
(Fake Boyfriends)

767
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:30,773
You came to see Dr. Wandee so early in the morning.

768
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,164
I actually slept here last night.

769
00:50:33,191 --> 00:50:35,280
About Yoryak, your fake boyfriends.

770
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:36,755
You don’t really need to do that.

771
00:50:36,977 --> 00:50:37,564
What?

772
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,791
Sleep here?

773
00:50:38,951 --> 00:50:42,062
Tonight, try not to go overboard tonight with your activity.

774
00:50:42,097 --> 00:50:43,484
Dr. Ter has seen my Story.

775
00:50:43,528 --> 00:50:44,533
Isn’t that too fast of him?

776
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,973
Are you jealous of me?

777
00:50:46,017 --> 00:50:46,880
Will you be my boyfriend?

778
00:50:47,057 --> 00:50:47,768
Yes!
