1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,080
You made them believe you're seeing someone.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,550
Where will you find a guy to be your date now?

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,110
How about we pretend to be in a relationship for four months?

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,820
But this is too much to ask from me.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,560
Just leave.

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,140
Yak.

7
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,140
I’ll agree to be your fake boyfriend,

8
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,770
only if within the next five minutes, you can land a punch on me.

9
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,520
Can I ask? About this fake relationship,

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,090
why does it have to be me?

11
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,990
You successfully landed a punch on me.

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,750
Let’s be fake boyfriends.

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,650
I’m here, Mom.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,530
I won today too, Mom.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,510
I won today too, Mom.

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,540
I won today too, Mom.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,480
I won today too, Mom.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,930
Mom.

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,660
I’m here, Mom.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,270
I’m here.

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,470
Can you please stay with me?

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,910
I’m here, Mom.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,440
I’m sorry, Mom.

24
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,840
I’m sorry.

25
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,940
You awake?

26
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,520
Um.

27
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,360
Still hours left until dawn.

28
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,660
Go back to sleep.

29
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,450
Darling.

30
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,010
Plakao.

31
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,840
Dee’s not with you?

32
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,990
I always see you two together.

33
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,850
Ah, he has his boyfriend to be with now.

34
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,370
He’s not clingy to me anymore.

35
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,440
He told me he liked me not long ago,

36
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,720
and then a few days later,

37
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,530
he introduced his new boyfriend.

38
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,770
Isn't that a bit too soon?

39
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,560
Don’t you think?

40
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,270
Uh…

41
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,500
Not really.

42
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,960
Totally normal.

43
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,860
You should know that he can move on fast.

44
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,620
But…

45
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,620
It seems way too fast this time.'

46
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,160
Why do you care?

47
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,000
You don’t like him that way, do you?

48
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,810
I’m just asking.

49
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,010
Dr. Ter.

50
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,310
If you genuinely want the best for Dee.

51
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,040
Now that he’s seeing someone and seems happy,

52
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,320
shouldn't you be happy for him?

53
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,840
Hello, Kwan.

54
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,920
You’re quite a big eater.

55
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
You also bought takeout for later.

56
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,400
Why not?

57
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,580
It’s delicious.

58
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,200
You can’t help but eat it over and over, right?

59
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
You and your dirty mind.

60
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,760
I made this sandwich for you.

61
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,530
I noticed that you don’t have morning shifts.

62
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,150
Thank you so much.

63
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,720
You really don’t have to. I feel bad for inconveniencing you.

64
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,820
Not at all.

65
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,820
I usually make this for myself.

66
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,180
I just made a few extra today.

67
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,410
Thank you.

68
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,760
I hope you enjoy it.

69
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,600
Hi, Dr. Dee.

70
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,290
Where did you come from?

71
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,340
We went to buy some rice porridge.

72
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,140
What brings you here, Dr. Kwan?

73
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,490
She dropped by to give me this sandwich.

74
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,430
Dr. Ter told me he wanted to have it.

75
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,010
You came to see Dr. Wandee so early in the morning.

76
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,170
Ah, I didn’t.

77
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,240
I actually slept here last night.

78
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,150
Yes.

79
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Please excuse us then.

80
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,660
See you at the hospital, Dr. Kwan.

81
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,060
See you.

82
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,470
They have really good chemistry together.

83
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,330
Doc.

84
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,220
Are you okay?

85
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,750
With what?

86
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,750
Dr. Ter.

87
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,420
With that lady doc.

88
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,560
You seemed pretty tense back there.

89
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,010
Who? I wasn’t.

90
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,480
Give me a break. I don’t feel anything.

91
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,350
Okay. I’ll try to believe that you don’t feel anything.

92
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,320
I said I don’t feel anything.

93
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,920
Stop it, Yak.

94
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,320
You don’t feel anything?

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,670
Why use that tone though?

96
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,680
You just don’t want to admit it.

97
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:12,310
(You wanted to have this, so I got it for you.
This place is really good. Try it. - Dee…)

98
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,300
Wow.

99
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,360
This is seriously delicious.

100
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
You eat a lot. You might gain weight.

101
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,860
That’s alright.

102
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,150
I’m trying to gain more weight.

103
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,540
Yei wants me to climb up a weight class.

104
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
That’s why you go hard on this.

105
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:57,200
So you really don’t have feelings for Dr. Ter anymore?

106
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,940
Come on, Yak.

107
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,160
Do you have OCD or what?

108
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,280
Wait.

109
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,430
You keep asking me that.

110
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,220
Are you jealous?

111
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,440
What crap are you talking about?

112
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,320
Feeling jealous is what I’m talking about.

113
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,990
I don’t feel jealous, but worried.

114
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,930
Someone might end up getting drunk and crying beside the trash again.

115
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,680
It’ll become my trouble to carry you back.

116
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,720
But from the way I see it, it looks like someone who is jealous.

117
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,560
I’m not jealous.

118
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,860
We’re not real boyfriends.

119
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,650
Why would I get jealous?

120
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,510
Really?

121
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,200
More importantly,

122
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,010
I already have someone I like.

123
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,330
You’re already seeing someone?

124
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,010
Really? I just realized I never asked.

125
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,630
Were you already dating someone when I asked you to be my fake boyfriend?

126
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,040
I’m not,

127
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,640
otherwise, I wouldn’t have agreed to be your fake boyfriend.

128
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,120
But you said you have someone you like.

129
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,690
That’s right.

130
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,520
Her name is Taemrak.

131
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,230
She’s a junior at my university.

132
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,960
She helps me with my studies.

133
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,570
What a cute name–Taemrak.

134
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,570
Her nature is cute too.

135
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,660
I like her.

136
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,410
But…

137
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,380
I don’t think she likes me that way.

138
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,010
What makes you think that she doesn’t like you?

139
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,550
I’m not quite sure. She seems indifferent towards me, I think.

140
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,680
When she’s with someone else, she’s more cheerful and lively.

141
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,580
Have you tried to win her over?

142
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,010
Like making a serious move on her.

143
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,840
Not yet.

144
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,210
I’m afraid of losing her.

145
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,210
You don’t know how to flirt, do you?

146
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,920
Do you want me to teach you?

147
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,920
Come on.

148
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,670
Do you have the audacity to teach anyone?

149
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,190
You can’t even successfully win Dr. Ter’s heart.

150
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,890
Oi.

151
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,700
Stop rubbing that in my face.

152
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,690
You might as well stab me with this knife.

153
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,160
Alright. Show me how you make a move on Taemrak.

154
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,190
Hey, Taem.

155
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,070
So what are we to each other?

156
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,070
We’ve known each other for so long.

157
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,360
Can you make it clear to me?

158
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,870
No wonder you keep failing to win her heart.

159
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,630
That’s so lackluster.

160
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,370
What should I do then?

161
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,260
You must be a little softer.

162
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,080
Tell her how you feel about her first.

163
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,250
You can’t just ask what you are to each other.

164
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,810
No woman would have an answer for that.

165
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:47,810
Really?

166
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,090
Hey.

167
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,760
Hand grab?

168
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,840
You should ask first if you can hold her hand.

169
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,160
Let’s assume that she allows me.

170
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,570
Okay.

171
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,020
Then?

172
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,370
Taem,

173
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,670
we’ve known each other for quite some time.

174
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,750
Not good. Still the same pattern.

175
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,110
Let me finish it.

176
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,010
Taem,

177
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,650
whenever we’re together,

178
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,890
every moment we share,

179
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,400
from the first day until now,

180
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,040
I call it happiness.

181
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,130
So…

182
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,530
if it’s possible at all,

183
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,700
can I have a chance to take care of you?

184
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,400
Would you be my date?

185
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
What’s up, Yei?

186
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,900
(Hey, Yak. Your next fight is settled.)

187
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,820
(Let’s talk about the details when you’re back.)

188
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,960
Okay, got it. I’ll be right there.

189
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,950
You have another bout coming?

190
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:56,940
Yes.

191
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:58,960
Anyway, Doc.

192
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,330
Did you like that?

193
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,470
Do you think Taem will like that approach?

194
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,330
Ah.

195
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,770
I think she probably likes it.

196
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,010
Really?

197
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,350
Yes!

198
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,710
That gives me energy for training.

199
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,290
This one is gonna be a bit tough.

200
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,890
You must gain weight to move up to this weight class

201
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,560
because there are no more opponents left for you to fight,

202
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,000
only foreign boxers.

203
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:33,650
Okay.

204
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,570
Why do you have to move him up a weight class?

205
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,320
Isn’t it too risky?

206
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,700
That’s alright, Cher.

207
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,720
Yei needs money.

208
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:41,910
Yak…

209
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,310
We’re not a big boxing camp.

210
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,520
Time is short.

211
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,950
Yak has only four months until the world championship tournament.

212
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,450
We need money.

213
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,680
Let’s do it, bro.

214
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,770
I can handle this, Cher.

215
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,270
By the way, Yei.

216
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,520
After this fight,

217
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,800
can I have a brief break?

218
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,540
I want to wrap up my studies.

219
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
I want everything sorted before the championship.

220
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,410
Sure, my bro.

221
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,370
But I still don’t understand.

222
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,840
Why do you keep pursuing your studies?

223
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,790
You don’t need a degree to be a boxer.

224
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,430
Just let me finish it.

225
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,090
Let’s continue watching.

226
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,860
Your mother seemed like a very kind person.

227
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,000
Um.

228
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,720
She’s the kindest in the world.

229
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,290
I kinda miss her.

230
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,750
By the way,

231
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,750
Dr. Wandee has confirmed his class this evening.

232
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,070
Alright. I’m not gonna bail.

233
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,000
I know.

234
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,920
You haven’t been objecting to teaching him lately.

235
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,920
He must be really special

236
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,920
or else you wouldn’t have given him your necklace.

237
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,810
I gave it to him for another reason.

238
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,190
Oh, really?

239
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,000
I thought he was the one.

240
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,070
Come on.

241
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,320
You know who I have feelings for.

242
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,730
I used to know.

243
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,920
But now I’m not quite certain who exactly you have feelings for.

244
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,810
Don’t be absurd.

245
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,810
I’m not someone who changes his mind easily.

246
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,770
Coach.

247
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,520
Keep going.

248
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,560
Can I have a break, Coach?

249
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,900
I can’t do it anymore.

250
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,800
I can’t do it anymore.

251
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,820
Are you okay? Your face is red.

252
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,930
Feeling unwell?

253
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,750
But no fever.

254
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,720
Let me grab my stuff to check on you.

255
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,450
Doc.

256
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,720
No need to.

257
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,760
Why?

258
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,950
If you have a fever, I can give you treatment.

259
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,400
Your next match is coming.

260
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,650
I’m fine.

261
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,080
You’re not fine.

262
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,410
Your face and ears are red.

263
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,540
I’m really fine.

264
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,930
I just…

265
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,730
find you cute.

266
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,320
What’s wrong with you?

267
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,820
What’s with the sudden flattery?

268
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,260
Now, your face is turning red.

269
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,470
What’s wrong?

270
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,820
Are you not feeling well?

271
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Want me to grab a thermometer to check if you have a fever?

272
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,800
I told you not to tease me.

273
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,280
Dare to tease me?

274
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,990
Yak.

275
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,180
Hey, Taem.

276
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,840
You’re here.

277
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,230
Sorry. Did I make you wait too long?

278
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,129
This needs to be submitted on Tuesday before noon.

279
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,470
It’s an assignment from Prof.

280
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,940
And these…

281
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,510
the study notes for the test next week.

282
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,000
You can just read through them,

283
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,460
and I can assure you that you’ll pass the test.

284
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,420
Okay.

285
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,350
Woah.

286
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,030
You even highlighted them for me?

287
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,620
Um.

288
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,420
Thank you so much,

289
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,850
My beloved Taem.

290
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,870
Please change ‘my beloved’ to cash for me.

291
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,120
What a mood-killer.

292
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,400
Are you in the middle of coaching?

293
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,040
Your client is really cute.

294
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,480
Not cute at all.

295
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,410
He’s one stubborn student.

296
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,080
Hey, Taem.

297
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,430
Would you like to stay for dinner?

298
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,060
I’ll have Cher prepare some more food.

299
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,680
Um…

300
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,990
I’d rather not.

301
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,880
The food here is just chicken breast and boiled eggs.

302
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,080
Those are all good stuff.

303
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,250
Kidding.

304
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,670
I’ve got some errands to run for the Student Council.

305
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,980
I see.

306
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,840
You are quite dedicated to the Student Council.

307
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,950
Of course.

308
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,190
The council helps monitor the rights for all students.

309
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,920
I must dedicate myself.

310
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,690
That’s what Student Council President Ohm said to me.

311
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,120
Yes?

312
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,710
I’m done. I’ll go with you.

313
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,970
Wait. Wait for me.

314
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,880
Ohm gave me a ride. He’s waiting outside.

315
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,320
I’m going back to campus with him.

316
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,670
No need to rush, Taem.

317
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,740
I can wait.

318
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,860
I already let the team know we’d be there a bit late.

319
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,560
I’m done here. Wait.

320
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,540
I’m good.

321
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,750
I’ve got to go now.

322
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,710
If you have questions on any points, text me.

323
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,850
Happy to explain them all.

324
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:49,940
Thanks.

325
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,780
Okay.

326
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,970
See you.

327
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,630
A jealous man has been sighted at Phadetseuk Boxing Club.

328
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,940
A man who will be ordered to do more situps

329
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,940
has been sighted at Phadetseuk Boxing Club.

330
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,380
Come on, Coach. I’m pooped.

331
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,480
No, you must do it. Now.

332
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,270
Taem seems very lovely.

333
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,050
You should make your move fast

334
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,360
before that cute-looking guy steals her from you.

335
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,640
I'm counting to five. Start doing situps.

336
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,190
Taem seems to have feelings for you

337
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,520
otherwise she wouldn’t help you with your assignment.

338
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,260
5

339
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,530
- Come on. - 	4

340
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,280
No.

341
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,130
3

342
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,530
2

343
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,330
Fine, I’ll do it.

344
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,330
Were you a calculator in your previous life?

345
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,960
You seem to be fond of counting so much.

346
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,800
Hold my ankles!

347
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,070
Got it.

348
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,610
Stop whining.

349
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Who do you think is more handsome, me or that fella?

350
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,990
That young man, definitely.

351
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,420
He carries himself well.

352
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,420
He seems to be much more decent too.

353
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,080
Are you taking a dig at me here?

354
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,300
No.

355
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,090
You asked me.

356
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,480
I just stated the fact.

357
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,300
Hey, Doc.

358
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,090
Can you help me dress to look better than that guy?

359
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,540
In return for me agreeing to be your fake boyfriend.

360
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,490
What are you scheming?

361
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,320
I’m taking a shot with Taem as you suggested.

362
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,080
Great move.

363
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,260
You've come this far,

364
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,460
might as well give it a shot now.

365
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,730
I know, right?

366
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,210
Let’s do it and see if it works out in my favor or not.

367
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,570
Enough, Doc.

368
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,850
Don’t put in too much water.

369
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,630
It’s too hot.

370
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,000
Hot temperatures are not good for our bodies, you know.

371
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,390
Yak seems happy when he's with Dr. Dee, don't you think?

372
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,200
Yeah.

373
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,730
So, who does he have feelings for now?

374
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,730
Dr. Dee or Taemrak?

375
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,450
Well, I think

376
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,990
we have to let him figure out his own feelings

377
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,180
before he can make a choice.

378
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,580
Do you mind, though?

379
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,090
I don't mind at all.

380
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,060
When I introduced you to him, he didn’t have any objections.

381
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,970
Whoever my brother loves, I'll love that person too.

382
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,540
You sound handsome.

383
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,140
If I weren't handsome,

384
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,060
I wouldn't have won the heart of someone as cute as you.

385
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,210
Now give me a cheek to kiss.

386
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,320
Why do you want to kiss me? Stop.

387
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,180
Why can’t I?

388
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,660
I haven’t taken a shower, and neither have you.

389
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,400
You’re sticky.

390
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,640
Then give me a shower.

391
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,130
No.

392
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,230
Come on.

393
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,640
No.

394
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,940
Come on. Please.

395
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,350
No.

396
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,570
You do it alone.

397
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,570
I can’t scrub my back.

398
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,400
We’ve been together for 10 years.

399
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,480
Our sex life isn’t exciting anymore.

400
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,760
It’s probably because we've gotten used to it.

401
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,950
Doing the same thing over and over becomes boring.

402
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,210
It makes me lose my sexual desire.

403
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,040
I’ve tried many things actually–

404
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,440
chains or handcuffs,

405
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,940
wigs, backdoor, watching porn,

406
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,810
I did everything, even if it's not really me.

407
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,320
It still doesn’t work.

408
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,540
Maybe I should try having sex with someone else?

409
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,950
To be in a relationship,

410
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,320
I understand that sex can become an important element,

411
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,480
especially for certain people.

412
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,610
But for others, sex may not hold the same importance.

413
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,100
Let’s slowly try to figure out

414
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,560
what can be a bridge to reconnect you both

415
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,830
and revive the passion in your sexual life.

416
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,890
Hey, Dee.

417
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,310
Within the last five minutes,

418
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,500
you've been sighing like ten million times already, you know.

419
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,660
Anything you want to share with me?

420
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,510
I think I find myself

421
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,310
getting jealous over Yak.

422
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,620
I know he and I are in a fake relationship.

423
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,140
Somehow, I get jealous of his crush.

424
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,520
Shit. That’s serious.

425
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,980
Not just that.

426
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,490
I gave my word to Yak

427
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,570
that I would help him pursue that girl he likes.

428
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,680
Gosh, Dee!

429
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,000
You are so you, man!

430
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,590
Why do you complicate the thing that’s already complicated?

431
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,310
Kao…

432
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,690
What should I do?

433
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,710
First of all,

434
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,210
you must hold off on your heart

435
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,990
before it gets hurt even more.

436
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,050
Dee, you tend to mix things up and add drama to them.

437
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,000
I think you should take some time for yourself

438
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,940
and sort out your own feelings.

439
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,040
Figure out what really bothers you.

440
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,900
What's causing it? Or who's causing it?

441
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,670
Mind if I join your swim, Doc?

442
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:41,040
I thought you would be late, so I came swimming here.

443
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,160
I started my training early and finished up quick.

444
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,720
Don’t you have to see Taemrak today?

445
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,330
No. I didn’t go to uni today.

446
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,350
Doc.

447
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,830
After my next fight,

448
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,990
we should start our plan to win Taem’s heart.

449
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,810
Why “we”?

450
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,680
Come on, Doc.

451
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,770
You agreed to help me.

452
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,520
But this is something you should take on solo.

453
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,660
No, Doc.

454
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,970
I’ve been trying to win her over for years,

455
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,420
but she doesn’t like me back.

456
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,130
With your help, I might stand a better chance.

457
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,400
Come on.

458
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,560
Please help me.

459
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,980
Think of it as

460
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,530
repayment for my assistance with your mission.

461
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,420
Alright.

462
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,160
Great.

463
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,390
You don’t really need to use this method.

464
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,770
What are you talking about?

465
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,430
If it’s about the scholarship, I think I’ve made myself clear.

466
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,790
About Yoryak,

467
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,650
your fake boyfriend.

468
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,040
What do you mean fake?

469
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,350
He’s my real boyfriend.

470
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,960
You also saw him staying over at my place the other night.

471
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,140
He stayed over just so I’d see?

472
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,510
What do you mean?

473
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,910
Doesn’t it seem too coincidental?

474
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,740
How coincidental that the boxer guy showed up with flowers

475
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,280
right when everyone was on break.

476
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,400
How coincidental that he and you appear

477
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,600
at the same time I usually go to the condo’s fitness room.

478
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,880
And what’s the coincidence today

479
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,880
that made you come talk to me about this?

480
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,390
This is not a coincidence. I wanted to be here.

481
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,390
You really don’t need to do that.

482
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,800
I have my case to take care of.

483
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,850
Excuse me.

484
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,280
Can’t you wait for me a little longer?

485
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,720
I was just confused before.

486
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:41,210
Now, I’m trying to get everything to fall into place.

487
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,590
Stop doing this.

488
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,040
It doesn’t work with me anymore.

489
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,840
I have Yoryak now.

490
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,400
And I’ll move forward to compete for this scholarship with you.

491
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:12,750
1 2

492
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,680
Okay!

493
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,760
We've gone to this length, and he still doesn't believe us?

494
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,810
I can’t believe it either.

495
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,320
He thought he could pressure me into giving up on the scholarship.

496
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,950
You think?

497
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,970
Apparently.

498
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,100
Don’t forget he’s smart and sneaky.

499
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,200
He managed to make me think he had feelings for me for years.

500
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,480
He got me to do all sorts of stuff for him for eight years.

501
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,630
He's that manipulative?

502
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,940
Dr. Ter, really?

503
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,780
Yep.

504
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,500
It's not what you built up in your head, is it?

505
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,660
Hey, Yak.

506
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,720
Whose side are you on?

507
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,640
Your side, of course.

508
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,240
So, how do we make him believe?

509
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:04,660
Actually, I've got an idea.

510
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,700
I don’t think the real cunning schemer is Dr. Ter.

511
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,640
It’s you, Doc.

512
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,440
Yoryak.

513
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,700
Alright, I'll stop teasing.

514
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,420
So, what's the plan? Tell me.

515
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,330
What?

516
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,540
Sleep here?

517
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:29,960
Yes.

518
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,520
Dr. Dee will stay over tonight.

519
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,190
We have to discuss a few things.

520
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,090
like training,

521
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,970
and also my shoulder problem.

522
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,850
Yes.

523
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,260
Dr. Dee has some new physiotherapy techniques to teach me

524
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,620
before the championship fights.

525
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,080
Is that so?

526
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,280
Yes, it is.

527
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,690
Right, Doc?

528
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,980
Right.

529
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,400
Actually, there are a lot of physiotherapy exercises he needs to practice.

530
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,490
Given our clashing schedules,

531
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,690
tonight is the night to do it.

532
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,120
Ah.

533
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,010
What do you think, Cher?

534
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,480
What?

535
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,390
Ah, I have no problem.

536
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,580
Well then, I’ll go prepare a room for you.

537
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,040
It’s okay, Cher.

538
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,520
Tonight, Doc.

539
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,210
Dr. Dee will sleep in my room.

540
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,950
Yes, it’s totally fine.

541
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,950
I’m pretty chill, right?

542
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
I can sleep in his bed.

543
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,270
No, Doc.

544
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,270
Don’t show my face.

545
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,930
I know.

546
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,110
Let’s do this. Give me your hand.

547
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,580
We can hold hands instead.

548
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,790
Put them here.

549
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,080
Okay.

550
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,110
Okay.

551
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,180
You’re posting it on your Story?

552
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,110
Yes, I want Dr. Ter to see it.

553
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,500
Doc.

554
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,700
How about this?

555
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,420
What?

556
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,400
Lay on my lap.

557
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,510
I’ll hold the camera.

558
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,020
When you’re on my lap, I’ll take your picture.

559
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,780
This way it will look more romantic.

560
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,810
Alright.

561
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,440
Like this.

562
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,600
Yes. Good.

563
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,060
Okay now?

564
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,960
Now look into my eyes.

565
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,450
And do this cutie patootie face.

566
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,660
Yes.

567
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,400
Can I have my phone back?

568
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,370
I want to post my Story.

569
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:01,970
Hey.

570
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,590
Dr. Ter has seen my Story. Yes!

571
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,600
What?

572
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,700
Isn’t that too fast of him?

573
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,280
Does he have notifications on?

574
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,060
Hey.

575
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,050
Are you jealous of me?

576
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,910
Who’s jealous?

577
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,360
You’re talking nonsense.

578
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,690
It’s obvious that you are jealous.

579
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,520
I’m not.

580
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,990
I totally saw that you are jealous.

581
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,920
I said I’m not.

582
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,000
You are.

583
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,790
I’m not.

584
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,290
You are.

585
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:27,930
I’m not.

586
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,990
Yeah.

587
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,340
This boxing club was founded in B.E. 2532,

588
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,470
as you see on the t-shirt.

589
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,950
My mom said after starting this gym, she had me and Yak.

590
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,710
Really?

591
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,060
This one is cooked.

592
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,840
Eat something too.

593
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,000
Don’t just listen to Yei's babbling.

594
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,900
If you wait until he's done, you might not get to eat anything.

595
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,180
Hey, you little...

596
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,230
Yak's got a point there.

597
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,010
Hey, Cher. You're my babe.

598
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,840
Why are you taking his side?

599
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,130
It's totally okay, guys.

600
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,680
I like listening to people.

601
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,020
My patients usually share their stories with me.

602
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,900
Come on. Don’t be so nice.

603
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,730
That makes me look like a bad guy here.

604
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,150
I didn't mean that.

605
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,120
You haven't eaten it.

606
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,720
Want me to feed you?

607
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,810
Open your mouth.

608
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,939
It's still hot.

609
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,140
Blow on it.

610
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,530
Or do you want me to do that for you too?

611
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,060
I can do it myself.

612
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,280
Dip too.

613
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,510
Wow.

614
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,020
It's delicious.

615
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,040
Seriously, both the pork and the dip are good.

616
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,990
Yei is the cook.

617
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,250
Wow.

618
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:50,010
It's our family’s recipe. Our mom and dad created it.

619
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,010
It’s so good you could open a restaurant.

620
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,150
Where are your mom and dad?

621
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Let’s enjoy our food.

622
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,000
Have lots of pork. Yei marinated it really well.

623
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,760
Everyone, finish it all because pork is expensive.

624
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,410
Come on, eat up.

625
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,900
Hey, Yak. You know that your next fight is coming up, right?

626
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:27,970
Yep.

627
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:37,240
Tonight, try not to go overboard tonight with your activity.

628
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,140
Got it?

629
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:39,890
Yei!

630
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,160
This isn't the place to talk about that.

631
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,720
Yak.

632
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,640
What are you doing?

633
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,570
Studying?

634
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,360
Yes. I have a test in the morning.

635
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,820
Do you still need to study?

636
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,050
Didn’t you say you made millions from a boxing match?

637
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,400
This has nothing to do with boxing.

638
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,300
I want to graduate.

639
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,210
It’s someone’s dream.

640
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,020
Is it hard, dear?

641
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,800
Very hard, Mom.

642
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,800
No matter how much I read, I just couldn’t grasp it.

643
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,640
Hang in there, dear.

644
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,040
Study hard.

645
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,030
I’m waiting to have a picture with you on your graduation day.

646
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,150
Come on, Mom.

647
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,890
Let me try to make it through high school first.

648
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,890
My son is very talented.

649
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,860
I’m sure you can do it.

650
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,300
You flatter me too much.

651
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,190
My back is itchy. Can you scratch it?

652
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,530
Okay. Here?

653
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,800
No, a bit to the left.

654
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,030
- Right here?
- 	Yes.

655
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,870
You know, your mom would be really proud of you.

656
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,280
You think so?

657
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,650
Yes.

658
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,410
I want my mom to feel proud of me too.

659
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,080
Doc.

660
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,620
Do you think a thickhead like me can pull this off?

661
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,280
Without a doubt.

662
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,380
In the ring, you've got to read your opponent's game.

663
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,400
I’m sure that’s much harder than this book.

664
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,770
You’ve got a point.

665
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,300
Hey.

666
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,250
I learned this subject too.

667
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,200
Want me to tutor you?

668
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,450
Are you serious?

669
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,360
Yes.

670
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Let this doctor teach you.

671
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,590
This bone is called fibula. It’s the calf bone.

672
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,440
Take a look at this image.

673
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,240
This is the bone that…

674
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:13,260
Each leg has 14 bones.

675
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,460
Each toe has 3 bones.

676
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,950
What’s wrong? Feeling itchy?

677
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,210
Yes. Itchy in the back.

678
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,710
I can’t reach the spot.

679
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,030
Want my help?

680
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,590
Can you move a bit further to the middle?

681
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,830
A bit lower.

682
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,530
Yeah.

683
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,280
Let’s continue.

684
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,380
Doc.

685
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:10,400
Hm?

686
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,170
Thank you.

687
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,380
Um.

688
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,980
Do your best here.

689
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,860
Break time?

690
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,630
Yes.

691
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,500
You were looking at Dr. Dee’s Story with his boyfriend?

692
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,780
Sorry, I accidentally saw your screen.

693
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,150
Yes, I swiped and his Story showed up.

694
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,780
Aren’t they lovely together?

695
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,690
They stay over at each other’s places.

696
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,690
They even post on Story to announce their relationship.

697
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,330
But Dr. Dee should be more cautious about his professional image.

698
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,770
He's too careless.

699
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:40,160
This match is in the weight class that Yoryak had to increase his weight for

700
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,010
in order to fight a brutal and ruthless opponent like Big Boy JC.

701
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,560
Let’s root for him.

702
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:46,980
Go Yoryak go!

703
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,480
Yoryak Phadetseuk!

704
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,020
Go Yoryak go!

705
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,470
Yoryak Phadetseuk!

706
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,840
Yay!!!

707
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,450
Yes!

708
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,360
You are awesome. Congrats.

709
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,240
I’ll prepare a special gift for you tonight.

710
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,140
(You are awesome. Congrats. I’ll prepare a special gift for you tonight.)

711
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:48,000
Kao, have you ever seen this?

712
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:53,200
I just learned that hundreds of thousands watch boxing matches live.

713
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,000
Wow.

714
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:57,220
Yak is truly incredible.

715
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,660
He successfully gained weight to compete in the upper weight class.

716
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,920
And he also managed to find time to study for his exams.

717
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,130
Best of all, he passed his exams too!

718
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,850
Dee, I think you’re really into him.

719
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,790
From the way he treats you,

720
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,240
there's a good chance he feels the same way.

721
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,240
What do you mean?

722
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,540
You two are really into each other.

723
00:47:20,844 --> 00:47:23,920
You crossed the line of fake boyfriends long ago.

724
00:47:23,982 --> 00:47:26,222
Kao, keep it down.

725
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:29,013
Do you want the whole hospital to know I have a fake relationship?

726
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:31,010
But your situation is a really interesting case.

727
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,391
What are you getting at?

728
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,360
The fact that you two, who pretend to be in a relationship,

729
00:47:35,404 --> 00:47:39,182
look much happier than many of my patients who are in real relationships.

730
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,991
Me and Yak?

731
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:43,031
We look happy?

732
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:45,030
You look   happy.

733
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,942
Hey, Dee.

734
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,466
Can you do me a favor?

735
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,404
Sure.

736
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:54,640
What is it?

737
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,577
Well, I’m experimenting with something

738
00:47:59,164 --> 00:48:01,160
that could benefit my patient treatments

739
00:48:01,573 --> 00:48:03,111
and potentially become an additional business for me.

740
00:48:03,137 --> 00:48:04,240
Woah.

741
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:05,573
That sounds like a big deal.

742
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,808
Do you think I can help?

743
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,311
You can.

744
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,382
Definitely can.

745
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:22,657
If being yourself makes it increasingly difficult to reveal your true feelings,

746
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:25,751
I'm curious to see if my Sleepless Sleepwear idea

747
00:48:25,786 --> 00:48:29,244
can help release those suppressed feelings.

748
00:48:29,564 --> 00:48:30,257
Hey!

749
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,453
What’s up, Big Bunny?

750
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,884
What’s up, Teeny Tiger?

751
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,888
Do you need to be this sexy being a tiger?

752
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,404
Brace yourself for this tiger attack.

753
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:58,311
Fierce huh?

754
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,315
Yak!

755
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,382
It feels great to get to be someone else.

756
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:14,853
Yes, Kao never disappoints me.

757
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,302
Kao?

758
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,506
Dr. Plakao, the psychiatrist?

759
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:24,462
That’s the one. He’s my one and only close friend.

760
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,026
What about me?

761
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:29,653
Well…

762
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:32,310
you’re not technically my close friend.

763
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,711
Hey.

764
00:49:36,995 --> 00:49:38,133
Why are you sulking?

765
00:49:39,671 --> 00:49:41,670
I’m not done yet.

766
00:49:42,017 --> 00:49:44,088
You are not my close friend

767
00:49:44,142 --> 00:49:47,128
but you are my super intimate close friend.

768
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:48,120
Okay?

769
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,360
Are we close enough now?

770
00:49:53,813 --> 00:49:54,275
Um.

771
00:49:59,537 --> 00:50:00,497
Enough.

772
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,653
If I hadn’t stumbled upon you drunk by the bus stop that night,

773
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,475
it would have been a shame.

774
00:50:10,684 --> 00:50:11,470
Yeah.

775
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:25,470
Yak.

776
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,288
Since we’re in this fake relationship,

777
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:31,866
can I propose something?

778
00:50:32,177 --> 00:50:33,031
What is it?

779
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,911
Don’t tell me…

780
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,208
you’re proposing that we get married.

781
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:43,200
No! That’s a bit too soon, don’t you think?

782
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,484
I want to take you to get a vaccination.

783
00:50:49,182 --> 00:50:50,231
What vaccine?

784
00:50:50,453 --> 00:50:52,230
HPV vaccine.

785
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:52,968
What?

786
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,506
Isn’t that for cervical cancer protection in females?

787
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:57,751
Why do I need it?

788
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,880
You need it.

789
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:05,048
The HPV virus is the main cause of skin infections

790
00:51:05,093 --> 00:51:07,600
that can occur in the genital areas

791
00:51:07,795 --> 00:51:10,515
and also there.

792
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:14,853
That means men should also get an HPV vaccine, Mr. Yoryak.

793
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:18,808
Are you worried about getting diseases via that?

794
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,382
I promise I’ll use this every time.

795
00:51:30,106 --> 00:51:32,100
I think I should get going now.

796
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,582
Wait.

797
00:51:34,142 --> 00:51:38,417
Do you know that thing can’t fully prevent STIs?

798
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:40,862
Just an intimate contact here…

799
00:51:41,066 --> 00:51:41,608
What?

800
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:43,262
or here

801
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,275
What?

802
00:51:44,462 --> 00:51:46,270
can expose you to viruses.

803
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:47,822
So…

804
00:51:47,991 --> 00:51:50,666
it’s the vaccine that can help protect you from viruses.

805
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,075
Come get the vaccine with me.

806
00:51:53,884 --> 00:51:55,070
Please.

807
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,204
Please, please, please, please.

808
00:52:00,231 --> 00:52:00,444
Please.

809
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:01,368
Enough.

810
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:04,702
I’ll go.

811
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:10,026
That’s so sweet of you, Big Doggie.

812
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,324
Thanks for doing it for me.

813
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,168
Next, Mr. Yoryak Phadetseuk, please.

814
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,244
Mr. Yoryak, are you here, sir?

815
00:53:08,204 --> 00:53:10,888
Where are you going, Mr. Yoryak?

816
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:17,164
Mr. Yoryak, this way, sir.

817
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,444
Ready?

818
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,275
Hang in there, Yak.

819
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:33,653
It’ll be over quickly.

820
00:53:34,595 --> 00:53:36,590
You are really cool, Mr. Yoryak.

821
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,106
Not just in boxing.

822
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,537
What do you mean?

823
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,982
Men who come to get the HPV vaccines

824
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,431
must care for and love their partners very much.

825
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,013
It’s done, sir.

826
00:53:53,422 --> 00:53:55,271
Don’t forget to come for all three injections.

827
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:56,977
Okay.

828
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,328
Thank you for coming here to get the vaccine.

829
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:07,857
It’s not a big deal. Just a little pinch.

830
00:54:08,951 --> 00:54:09,850
Doc.

831
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:12,222
You can book the next shot for me.

832
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,306
Now you’ve become brave.

833
00:54:16,364 --> 00:54:18,462
Why? I’m a boxer.

834
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,177
Getting punched is more hurtful.

835
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:28,862
Surprise!

836
00:54:28,888 --> 00:54:29,431
Grandma!

837
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,955
Hello, young man.

838
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:33,004
I’m a boxer.

839
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:36,346
So, he’s the reason you became interested in watching boxing.

840
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:40,444
If you weren’t special, he wouldn’t have given you his personal necklace.

841
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,515
We’re both getting closer to our goals.

842
00:54:45,297 --> 00:54:50,053
Actually, you have really sweet eyes, you know?
