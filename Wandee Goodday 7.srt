1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,300
What’re you doing, Yak?

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,550
Let me store up power charges for the future.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,410
Seminar in Japan?

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,870
Dee and I won’t disappoint you or the board.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,920
You need to choose now who you really have feelings for.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,660
What’s the deal with you and Dr. Wandee?

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,660
With you and Cher there,

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,900
I can’t help but think of the picture Oyei and I had with our mom and dad.

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,330
It seems like Yak introduced you to become a part of the Phadetseuk family.

10
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,500
Another nightmare?

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,020
Um.

12
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,460
It always seems to happen when a match is near.

13
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,850
Doc.

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,170
Hm?

15
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,370
Can you lend me a hand?

16
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,020
Feeling better now?

17
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,920
Thank you, Doc.

18
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,110
Hey, Yak.

19
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,900
About those nightmares.

20
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,360
Have you ever consulted with a psychiatrist?

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,700
Not yet.

22
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,560
They are just bad dreams.

23
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,200
It’s not that serious.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,010
But seeing a psychiatrist is totally normal, you know.

25
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,560
Do you want to consider it?

26
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,800
I can make an appointment for you.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,900
Maybe later.

28
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,510
We won’t be seeing each other for many days, huh?

29
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,450
Yes.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,300
Your trip is at the same time as my bout.

31
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,400
I’m a little stressed about it.

32
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,560
Worried I might not do it well.

33
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,210
Could I get your support?

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,100
I’m sure you’ll do well at your presentation.

35
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,650
Not always.

36
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,590
Sometimes the audience knocks me out.

37
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,130
If I manage it,

38
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,440
can I ask one thing from you?

39
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,900
What is it?

40
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,670
I want you to talk with Kao, my friend.

41
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,120
Nah, I’m perfectly fine.

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,200
Can’t I get that as a little reward?

43
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,300
Fine, I’ll do it.

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,710
Then if I win,

45
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,100
can I ask for something in return?

46
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,100
What do you want?

47
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,365
Bread’s ready.

48
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,515
Yak, let’s eat.

49
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:43,875
Um.

50
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:57,955
What’s wrong? Not feeling well?

51
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:00,705
Nothing.

52
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:07,155
Alright.

53
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:08,845
Let’s eat.

54
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:13,505
Cheers.

55
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:14,545
Yeah.

56
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:27,505
Don’t bail on me this evening.

57
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,685
I’ll wait for you at the gym.

58
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:31,005
I definitely won’t, Coach.

59
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:38,105
What are you going to do?

60
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,805
Just giving myself a shot.

61
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:44,445
Told you not to.

62
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:46,165
Then.

63
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,305
Let me have this.

64
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:55,605
See you later.

65
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,245
Um.

66
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,795
(Love Dr. Ter more than anything in the world.)

67
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:39,885
This going in the trash?

68
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:41,385
Yes.

69
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,005
Why keep it?

70
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:45,465
I’m a doctor, not a dog.

71
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:23,625
How’d it go?

72
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,035
Dating with Yak,

73
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,575
did you give him your kiss?

74
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:29,355
Not yet.

75
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:31,655
Why?

76
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,595
Well…

77
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:37,655
I’m still not sure.

78
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,325
For crying out loud, Dee.

79
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:41,065
Why are you still not sure?

80
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:43,475
Why didn’t you tell him you love him, kiss him,

81
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:44,325
and ask him out officially.

82
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,065
So this saga can end already.

83
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,875
Didn’t you say he’s someone you feel at ease with?

84
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:49,645
But can’t I have a little more time?

85
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:52,215
Why do you always like to complicate things?

86
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,455
Hey, Kao. I’m your friend.

87
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,565
You should take my side.

88
00:08:58,825 --> 00:08:59,465
Dee,

89
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:02,815
I can’t be on any side other than yours.

90
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:07,885
But kissing Yak doesn’t turn you into The Frog Prince.

91
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,005
Got it?

92
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:12,515
But this is my real life, not a fairy tale.

93
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:14,415
So, you’re choosing to do nothing about it?

94
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:16,055
huh?

95
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:19,725
Loving someone but not showing it from time to time

96
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:21,665
might lead to losing them, you know.

97
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:29,605
Yak.

98
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,115
This is Zazaki, your next contender.

99
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:36,915
But this match won’t affect the rankings.

100
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,445
Just a warm-up fight to earn money for our gym, that’s all.

101
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:40,405
Then your job is done.

102
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,825
He looks quite something, Oyei.

103
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:46,205
Are you sure this is just a warm-up fight?

104
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:51,415
Shit.

105
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:53,015
What’s up, Yak?

106
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:02,505
Nothing. All good.

107
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,005
Hey, Yei.

108
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,015
I watched a video clip of his fight.

109
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:10,225
Don’t worry.

110
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:12,605
I’m sure this match will be a breeze.

111
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:15,565
Okay, great.

112
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:21,525
Doc,

113
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:23,875
I’ll be waiting around here.

114
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,315
Why’s that?

115
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:28,115
Don’t you have anything else to do?

116
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:31,115
I do, but it’s in the afternoon.

117
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:33,115
I want to wait for you to have lunch together first.

118
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:36,115
Waiting in the hospital, really?

119
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:37,135
Yes.

120
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:38,155
Why?

121
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:40,355
Isn’t it great?

122
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,875
This makes us look more like real boyfriends.

123
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:47,505
A sexy doctor and his hot boyfriend.

124
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:50,115
Let’s do it.

125
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:51,885
Wait here then.

126
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:53,885
But you may leave if it gets boring.

127
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:00,825
Sorry to interrupt.

128
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:01,465
Yes?

129
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:02,825
The examination room is ready.

130
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:04,195
Alright.

131
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:06,505
I have to get going now.

132
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:10,265
Work hard, Gooddy.

133
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:34,815
Can I have a word with you?

134
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:42,105
Now, say what you want.

135
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:45,165
You and Dee aren't actually dating, right?

136
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:48,165
What made you think so?

137
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:56,115
I saw you with a female student on the hospital's activity date.

138
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:57,685
So I did some research on you

139
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:03,005
and found that your fans post photos of you and her on social networks.

140
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:05,205
Ah, that.

141
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:08,005
Those are just candid photos, aren’t they?

142
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,335
I don’t know…

143
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,765
how serious you are with Dee.

144
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:14,415
But I want you to know

145
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,515
I've known Dee for eight years,

146
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:20,405
and I'm sure I know him better than you do.

147
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:23,705
I know what he likes or dislikes,

148
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:27,105
what is real or what is fake.

149
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,115
Are you sure

150
00:12:30,945 --> 00:12:34,005
that’s not just in your head?

151
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:37,265
Yes.

152
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:41,645
But if you don’t believe me,

153
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:44,155
I’ll make you see.

154
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:05,705
Wanna talk about it?

155
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:08,025
No.

156
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:09,705
Okay, I’ll leave you alone.

157
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:13,605
Hold on.

158
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:16,575
Fine, I’ll talk.

159
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,105
What’s bugging you?

160
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:23,215
Mommy is all ears, my baby.

161
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:26,135
How about a kick in the ass, Mommy?

162
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:28,155
Can you be serious?

163
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:31,365
Okay, going into serious mode in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1…

164
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,325
Here we go.

165
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:41,625
If you say you don’t care and have no feelings left,

166
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,385
do you still keep that person’s stuff?

167
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:50,075
Well, it varies from person to person.

168
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:52,765
Some people might just want to keep them as good memories,

169
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:55,425
even though they don’t think about that person anymore.

170
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:58,175
Is it possible?

171
00:13:59,105 --> 00:13:59,715
Yes,

172
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:01,605
and it’s not strange at all.

173
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:05,115
Who are you talking about, Dr. Dee or Taem?

174
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:07,465
Never mind.

175
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:08,865
Stop guessing.

176
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:13,405
Who could it be?

177
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,265
Dr. Dee or Taem

178
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:16,705
or someone else?

179
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,415
Put more force.

180
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:29,985
Come on.

181
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:38,685
What do we do after this?

182
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:42,515
(Some people might just want to keep them as good memories,

183
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,415
even though they don’t think about that person anymore.)

184
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:46,505
Yak.

185
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:48,155
Yak!

186
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:51,605
Ah…

187
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,505
Weight training next.

188
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:01,885
What should we dress up as tonight?

189
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:04,405
A patient and a doctor?

190
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:06,845
Or a cop and a suspect?

191
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:12,765
I miss Teeny Tiger.

192
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:17,275
Okay, I should go prepare the costume then.

193
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:21,325
Hey, I’m not falling for your trap.

194
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:22,975
Go do weight training now.

195
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,015
Who's trapping who exactly?

196
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:31,755
Weight training.

197
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:35,255
Then let go of me.

198
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,075
I can’t move with your tight arm lock.

199
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:46,105
Let’s go.

200
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:51,165
Go where?

201
00:15:54,765 --> 00:15:55,505
Weight training,

202
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:56,615
Go.

203
00:15:57,785 --> 00:15:58,715
Yak!

204
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:02,805
Lower them slowly.

205
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:04,915
Like this?

206
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,805
You look promising.

207
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,455
Yak.

208
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:14,565
Hm?

209
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:16,965
I don’t feel like going to Japan.

210
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:20,755
Why?

211
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:25,025
Isn’t it important for your scholarship?

212
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,265
It is.

213
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,215
But if I go,

214
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:38,715
we won’t see each other for several days, you know.

215
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:44,005
So,

216
00:16:44,865 --> 00:16:46,165
the one who misses the other first

217
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:47,665
is you, huh?

218
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:52,615
No, it's not.

219
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,265
Don’t assume it.

220
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:56,625
Get back to training.

221
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:57,715
Don’t slack off.

222
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:00,395
Come on.

223
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,645
How’s it going, Yak?

224
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:53,445
Doc!

225
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:54,905
Why do you want to come in?

226
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:56,515
Can’t I come in?

227
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:58,605
I want to see if you've showered thoroughly.

228
00:17:59,235 --> 00:17:59,965
No, Doc.

229
00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:00,785
People might see us.

230
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:02,905
So what if they see us?

231
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:06,685
Let me sniff.

232
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:08,855
Did you wash up well?

233
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:10,405
Doc!

234
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:13,015
Stop it. Get out of here.

235
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:14,105
Go.

236
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:14,905
Go!

237
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:15,885
Why do I have to?

238
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:16,915
What's to be embarrassed about?

239
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,305
Isn’t it normal?

240
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:24,605
Don’t mess with the system.

241
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:27,375
What if I do?

242
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:30,805
Where is Mr. Yoryak’s system?

243
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:32,665
Can I play with it?

244
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:35,884
If that’s what you want…

245
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,436
Yak.

246
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:55,942
No.

247
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:57,882
I haven’t showered yet.

248
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:01,007
Fine, I'll go.

249
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:03,813
See you at my condo.

250
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:11,180
What should I expect there?

251
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:15,387
I won’t tell you,

252
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:17,709
or else it's not called a surprise.

253
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:19,613
Bye.

254
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:23,460
Doc, hold on.

255
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:24,909
Doc!

256
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:36,420
Yak.

257
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,307
Where're you going?

258
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,478
You scared the hell out of me, Cher.

259
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,210
Are you sneaking out again?

260
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:48,916
If Yei finds out, you'll be in trouble.

261
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,959
Come on, Cher. Don’t tell him.

262
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,721
I’m going to see Doc.

263
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,617
Are you sick?

264
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,958
No, Dr. Dee.

265
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:02,312
He’s going to Japan soon.

266
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,919
I won’t be able to see him for several days.

267
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:07,971
I swear.

268
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:10,322
I won’t go partying elsewhere.

269
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,216
I swear on Yoryak Phadetseuk’s honor.

270
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:15,183
Fine.

271
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,888
Make sure to return for the training in the morning.

272
00:20:20,229 --> 00:20:21,447
You must not skip it.

273
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:22,813
Understood?

274
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:25,657
How lovely of you, my sis-in-law.

275
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:27,008
Just go.

276
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,702
Alright then.

277
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:33,884
Easy there.

278
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:35,875
Open the doors gently.

279
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:51,986
Don’t you smile.

280
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:53,887
This is not over the top.

281
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,516
I won’t see him for a while.

282
00:20:57,185 --> 00:20:58,552
It should be a little more special, right?

283
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:13,223
You’re here?

284
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:21,587
Dr. Ter.

285
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,118
Doc.

286
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:55,411
Are you asleep?

287
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:58,561
Doc!

288
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,576
Are you having a dinner date with someone?

289
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:47,666
I thought you wanted to discuss our presentation for the Japan seminar.

290
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,216
Join me for dinner before that,

291
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:52,796
then we can talk about it.

292
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:57,882
But, I thought…

293
00:22:58,386 --> 00:22:59,608
I haven’t eaten yet.

294
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:01,509
Please eat with me.

295
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:06,099
Dr. Ter, I…

296
00:23:06,822 --> 00:23:09,010
We haven’t had a meal together in a while.

297
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:15,207
I made fish steak for you.

298
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:21,528
How about we start with this?

299
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:43,014
Here’s to our research presentation in Japan.

300
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:15,881
I’m here.

301
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:18,811
Oh.

302
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:20,414
Has Dee already come back?

303
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:22,659
Not yet.

304
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:25,016
Do you know where Doc…

305
00:24:26,693 --> 00:24:27,884
Dr. Dee is?

306
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:30,737
Yes, he sent me a voice message.

307
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:40,313
I think we should start with this topic followed by yours.

308
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,213
What do you think?

309
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:44,020
I think that's a good idea.

310
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,568
It can show the info development more clearly.

311
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:48,025
Good.

312
00:24:49,691 --> 00:24:51,217
You are as genius and witty as always.

313
00:24:59,054 --> 00:25:01,269
You look pretty cute in this costume.

314
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:08,116
I’m glad that I’m going to Japan with you.

315
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:27,017
Well, I actually have plans with Yak tonight.

316
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:29,115
I didn’t bring my cellphone with me.

317
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:30,614
I didn’t think I would be here for long.

318
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:32,614
I should go back now.

319
00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:33,287
Wait.

320
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:36,413
Dr. Ter!

321
00:25:37,364 --> 00:25:38,116
I’m sorry.

322
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:39,521
I’ve made a mess.

323
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:42,413
It's okay.

324
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:43,811
Can you help clean up here?

325
00:25:43,823 --> 00:25:45,604
I’m going to wash myself and change my clothes.

326
00:25:57,746 --> 00:25:58,718
What the heck?

327
00:26:00,053 --> 00:26:00,709
Dr. Ter,

328
00:26:02,036 --> 00:26:03,107
what’s going on?

329
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:05,208
The faucet is broken.

330
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:07,414
Can you give me a hand?

331
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:09,613
S… sure.

332
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:25,762
Dee.

333
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:28,882
Dee!

334
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,734
Dee, are you there?

335
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,577
What’s up, Plakao?

336
00:26:37,207 --> 00:26:37,888
Where’s Dee?

337
00:26:39,387 --> 00:26:40,025
I’m here.

338
00:26:45,223 --> 00:26:45,887
Holy s...

339
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:48,319
Dee, why are you soaking wet?

340
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:54,807
Yak.

341
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:56,930
You’ve arrived?

342
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,165
Let’s go to our room.

343
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,210
You again?

344
00:27:02,493 --> 00:27:04,716
That’s quite a harsh greeting.

345
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:06,913
Oh, you're putting on the act of a naive good guy too?

346
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,410
No, I’m not.

347
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:10,416
This is my authentic self.

348
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:14,121
Probably, it’s you who can’t tell

349
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,007
what is authentic and what is fake?

350
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:19,422
Yak!

351
00:27:19,445 --> 00:27:20,211
Yak, no.

352
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:21,435
Don’t use violence.

353
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:22,519
Stop. Stop!

354
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,002
Why are you all about violence?

355
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:24,608
Stop!

356
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,613
Go back first.

357
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,559
Are you okay?

358
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:45,976
Yak.

359
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:48,214
Yak, wait.

360
00:27:53,786 --> 00:27:55,253
I think I'm the one you should talk to.

361
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,147
Yak.

362
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,263
Listen to me first, Yak.

363
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:05,008
Can you stop walking away from me?

364
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,139
Yak.

365
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,445
Yak.

366
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:15,525
Yak.

367
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,239
Let’s talk it out.

368
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,410
Don’t walk away.

369
00:28:23,014 --> 00:28:24,062
Can you stop following?

370
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:25,598
It’s annoying.

371
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:27,719
Don’t do this.

372
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:30,607
Do what?

373
00:28:32,198 --> 00:28:33,884
I've never done anything right in your eyes anyway.

374
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,211
Hold on. This is going too far.

375
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,885
I prepared all this delicious stuff for you.

376
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:44,082
I think we should end it here.

377
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,627
Yak,

378
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,110
calm down.

379
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:51,430
If you don’t want to talk right now, we can talk later.

380
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:52,583
Let’s talk about it here.

381
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:57,373
I don’t think your plan is working.

382
00:29:01,786 --> 00:29:03,607
Since our relationship is already fake,

383
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,010
if we want to end it,

384
00:29:08,805 --> 00:29:10,605
we should break up in a fake way too, right?

385
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,614
What are you talking about?

386
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:19,885
Let’s break up, Doc.

387
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,413
Can I have that back?

388
00:29:57,811 --> 00:29:58,345
Yak.

389
00:29:59,324 --> 00:30:00,527
You’re taking this way too far.

390
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:50,096
I thought I wouldn’t find anyone here.

391
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:52,724
I brought the paper you need to submit tomorrow.

392
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:10,251
Is everything okay?

393
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:26,709
Can you open the trunk for me?

394
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:38,687
(Heading to the airport now.)

395
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:45,879
(Are you coming to see me off?)

396
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,020
1, 2.

397
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:49,776
1, 2.

398
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:52,687
Whoa, your punches are really hard today.

399
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:56,112
Yeah, he's punching like he's mad at someone.

400
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,041
It's like he's mad at everyone on this planet.

401
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,382
Stop talking nonsense.

402
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:02,916
Come on.

403
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:05,645
Come on.

404
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:09,595
I've known Dee for eight years,

405
00:34:09,653 --> 00:34:10,847
I know what he likes,

406
00:34:11,227 --> 00:34:13,312
what is real or what is fake.

407
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:14,494
Why are you all about violence?

408
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:15,079
Stop!

409
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:16,610
Go back first.

410
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:17,879
Jab.

411
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:18,952
Jab.

412
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:19,983
1, 2.

413
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:21,975
- Great. - Time's up.

414
00:34:24,124 --> 00:34:27,519
Should we have Yak focus on weightlifting for now?

415
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,019
Sure.

416
00:34:30,396 --> 00:34:33,510
Yak, Dr. Dee called.

417
00:34:33,713 --> 00:34:34,525
Several times, actually.

418
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:35,970
Want to call him back during the break?

419
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,882
You keep it. I want to train.

420
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:41,605
You sure?

421
00:34:45,438 --> 00:34:48,208
I love it when Yak gets serious.

422
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,616
Reminds me of training for the world championship match.

423
00:34:55,122 --> 00:34:55,934
We should go now, Dee.

424
00:35:32,745 --> 00:35:37,195
JAPAN

425
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:02,707
Now that we’re here.

426
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:06,364
Don’t you want to go out for a change of scenery?

427
00:36:08,822 --> 00:36:09,617
I’d rather not.

428
00:36:10,427 --> 00:36:12,912
I want to focus on tomorrow’s presentation.

429
00:36:15,494 --> 00:36:16,707
You’re drinking quite a lot.

430
00:36:21,894 --> 00:36:22,605
You know,

431
00:36:24,454 --> 00:36:26,112
that day you confessed your love to me,

432
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:29,349
I was ecstatic.

433
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:34,513
At the time, I thought

434
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:37,665
I could only see you as a good little brother.

435
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,542
But then Yoryak came,

436
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,780
and I realized my true feelings for you.

437
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,368
You’re drinking too much.

438
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:01,290
You should go to bed now.

439
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,934
I’m not drunk.

440
00:37:06,244 --> 00:37:07,767
I know what I’m doing.

441
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:13,512
Dr. Ter.

442
00:37:17,062 --> 00:37:17,890
Walk slowly.

443
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:21,050
Dr. Ter!

444
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,267
Do you want to know

445
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:31,933
how I feel right now?

446
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:45,125
Dr. Ter!

447
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:47,940
Dr. Ter!

448
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:19,553
Yak,

449
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:24,023
if something is bothering you,

450
00:38:25,176 --> 00:38:26,496
you can share it with me.

451
00:38:29,688 --> 00:38:30,355
Nothing.

452
00:38:31,638 --> 00:38:32,672
I’m fine.

453
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,884
From the look on your face,

454
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:44,232
I think there's something.

455
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,379
Well…

456
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,419
I just feel…

457
00:38:58,445 --> 00:39:00,309
strange as the match gets nearer, I guess.

458
00:39:00,759 --> 00:39:03,506
Come on, you are a pro.

459
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:06,456
You can definitely handle it.

460
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:12,967
You think?

461
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:15,610
Yes, don’t worry too much.

462
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:18,173
Let’s have a climbing race.

463
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:19,593
Watch out!

464
00:39:49,242 --> 00:39:50,002
I think…

465
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:52,767
I should get going.

466
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:57,127
Do you want a ride?

467
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:00,207
Nah, I'm good.

468
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,313
Later then.

469
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,211
Alright, the day we’ve been waiting for is here.

470
00:40:41,227 --> 00:40:45,196
Let’s welcome two boxing superstars

471
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:47,105
who have finally come together for this anticipated fight.

472
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:49,687
From the land of the rising sun,

473
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:51,416
we have Zazaki, the dangerously handsome fighter,

474
00:40:51,435 --> 00:40:54,968
aka King Jr!!

475
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:01,330
Zazaki, Fighto!

476
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:03,053
Zazaki, Fighto!

477
00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:04,762
Zazaki, Fighto!

478
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:09,774
And please welcome the dashing fighter,

479
00:41:09,787 --> 00:41:12,905
on his way to becoming a world champion, beloved by all Thais…

480
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:17,556
Yoryak Phadetseuk, currently ranked 5th in the world!

481
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,463
Woah.

482
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:21,515
(Yoryak <3)

483
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:36,795
(Yoryak Phadetseuk)

484
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:39,884
Listen up.

485
00:41:40,389 --> 00:41:42,113
No punches below the belt,

486
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:43,810
no hitting on the back.

487
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:45,787
When I say separate, you must separate.

488
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,309
When I say stop, you must stop.

489
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:49,309
Show your sportsmanship.

490
00:41:49,616 --> 00:41:50,173
Alright.

491
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:51,170
Yoryak San.

492
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:54,774
Today, you’ll die.

493
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:58,073
Not me, but you.

494
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,810
I’m not gonna pull my punches.

495
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,408
Great.

496
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,510
Show me all you’ve got.

497
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,961
Yak, come on!

498
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:22,373
Come on, Yak.

499
00:42:30,302 --> 00:42:30,912
Yak!

500
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:37,413
Hey, what’s wrong with Yak?

501
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:48,105
Yak, why do you keep looking outside the ring?

502
00:42:48,345 --> 00:42:48,955
Yak!

503
00:42:49,808 --> 00:42:50,411
Hey!

504
00:43:04,472 --> 00:43:05,533
Yak, what’s wrong with you?

505
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:09,167
Yak!

506
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,273
Guard up!

507
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,647
Yak, put your guard up!

508
00:43:16,615 --> 00:43:18,509
Your guard, Yak!

509
00:43:23,396 --> 00:43:24,931
Yak.

510
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:25,712
Yak!

511
00:43:27,653 --> 00:43:28,530
Yak!

512
00:43:35,017 --> 00:43:37,559
And that brings me to the end of my presentation.

513
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:38,992
Thank you for your attention.

514
00:43:39,238 --> 00:43:40,470
Arigatou Gozaimasu.

515
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:29,315
What’s up, Kao?

516
00:44:29,642 --> 00:44:30,527
Is everything alright at the hospital?

517
00:44:32,185 --> 00:44:33,085
Have you seen the news?

518
00:44:34,577 --> 00:44:35,328
What news?

519
00:44:39,918 --> 00:44:41,373
“Was he completely out of form because his mind was on his lover

520
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:43,506
or did he just throw the fight?”

521
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:45,666
What an insult to us.

522
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,162
Yak!

523
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:48,758
Why did you do that?

524
00:44:49,408 --> 00:44:51,019
Do you know how much I've invested in you?

525
00:44:51,761 --> 00:44:52,856
Whether you sneak out

526
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:55,715
or spend time with your lover, it’s all cool with me.

527
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:57,665
But your performance in the ring like that–

528
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,222
it's unacceptable!

529
00:45:00,195 --> 00:45:02,313
Is this the dignity of a future world champion?

530
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:05,078
I never wanted it to turn out like this.

531
00:45:10,873 --> 00:45:11,884
I’m so…

532
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:15,583
f***ing disappointed!

533
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:17,697
Yei, enough.

534
00:45:21,278 --> 00:45:21,879
Yeah.

535
00:45:23,656 --> 00:45:24,707
Someone like me…

536
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,011
just keeps disappointing everyone–

537
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:31,379
you,

538
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:34,347
Mom,

539
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:36,931
Dee,

540
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,530
and everyone.

541
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,112
I suck.

542
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,013
Is that what you want to hear?

543
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,980
I utterly suck!

544
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:52,955
Yak!

545
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:54,525
Where are you doing?

546
00:45:55,276 --> 00:45:56,343
Let him go.

547
00:45:57,408 --> 00:45:58,310
Don’t go after him.

548
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,118
Come on, Yei.

549
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,564
Yak.

550
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:02,475
Doc.

551
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:08,227
I lost.

552
00:47:31,513 --> 00:47:32,614
What do you want?

553
00:47:36,315 --> 00:47:37,205
Your kiss.

554
00:47:39,793 --> 00:47:40,568
What?

555
00:47:43,142 --> 00:47:46,527
Give me your first kiss if I win.

556
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,107
Are you consoling me?

557
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:12,420
Yes.

558
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:14,875
Consider it a consolation reward.

559
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:26,672
But this kiss

560
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:30,626
is all from me.

561
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,368
Nothing to do with the reward.

562
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:49,882
Oh, you make me realize

563
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,888
Having you here is such a delight

564
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:57,801
Oh baby, I don’t want you to ever go away

565
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:01,782
Just the two of us, I won’t have it other way

566
00:49:02,128 --> 00:49:04,011
Baby, let me give it to you

567
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:07,377
Baby, I assure you it won’t be dull

568
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:09,845
It won’t hurt you at all, ahh

569
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:12,038
Baby, let me guarantee

570
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:15,542
Baby, once you try it, you’ll get down on your knees

571
00:49:15,615 --> 00:49:17,882
Begging to be with me

572
00:49:22,863 --> 00:49:23,884
This is coming around again?

573
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:25,334
Just one more time.

574
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:26,982
But it’s not really me at all.

575
00:49:27,116 --> 00:49:28,641
A wonderful night with your special person.

576
00:49:28,873 --> 00:49:30,915
The title already sounds like fun.

577
00:49:31,025 --> 00:49:34,419
So, are you going to that hospital’s anniversary ball?

578
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:37,875
I have something to talk to you about in private.

579
00:49:37,946 --> 00:49:39,448
I don’t think your fake boyfriend can make it here tonight.

580
00:49:39,545 --> 00:49:40,576
Be my dance partner tonight.

581
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:45,616
I'm afraid that when the time is up, Yak will disappear completely.
