1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
But you said you have someone you like.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,680
Her name is Taemrak. She’s a junior at my university.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,200
Have you tried to win her over?

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,080
He must be really special or else you wouldn’t have given him your necklace.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,280
What are you scheming?

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,800
I’m taking a shot with Taem as you suggested.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,480
I think I find myself getting jealous over Yak.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,400
Dee, you two are really into each other.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,640
You crossed the line of fake boyfriends long ago.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,120
Happy birthday to you

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,080
Happy birthday to you

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,879
Happy birthday, happy birthday

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,720
Happy birthday to you

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,760
Make a wish, dear.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,000
I wish for you to always have a day as wonderful as your name.

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,240
Isn’t it wonderful to have a special day like this?

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,040
It’s not hurting, not hurting.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,520
Happy birthday to you

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,000
Happy birthday, happy birthday

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,800
Happy birthday to you

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,360
Whose birthday is it today?

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,480
Is it Namphu the strong boy's birthday?

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,600
Yes, it’s my birthday, Namphu the strong boy.

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,680
Blow out the candles.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,280
Yeah.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,480
We don’t have just this cake.

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,880
Bro Yoryak also has a gift for you.

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,400
Here.

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,240
Happy birthday, Namphu.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,519
Thank you, Dr. Wandee.

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,960
Thank you, Bro Yoryak.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,800
Wow.

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,280
How are you today?

34
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,200
Is the pain as bad as yesterday?

35
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,280
It’s much better.

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,600
I want to recover fast.

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,800
I want to go back and play with my friends at school.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,960
How about a group power-up?

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,560
Let’s cheer for Namphu to get back to school early!

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,600
Let’s do it.

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
Here we go.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,679
Power up!

43
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Yeah!

44
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,600
But hold on.

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,200
How does a fighter put his guard up?

46
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,560
Wow.

47
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,320
Now show me how you punch.

48
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,920
Your punch is powerful.

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,880
Attaboy.

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,040
Bro Yoryak, when I grow up, I want to become a boxer like you.

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,280
Really?

52
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Yes.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,760
Let’s see if you’re qualified to be one.

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Show me your victory pose.

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,280
Thank you very much, Doctor, Mr. Yoryak.

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,120
You’re welcome.

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,840
When I was a kid,

58
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,920
every time I received a present, it made me happy.

59
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,840
At least it reminded me I hadn't been forgotten.

60
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,600
Thank you.

61
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, would you two mind having a picture with Namphu?

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,520
Not at all.

63
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,680
The gloves.

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,000
We must hold both the cake and the gloves.

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,160
Okay. Can you step closer to each other?

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,240
1, 2, 3.

67
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,280
Doc.

68
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,120
Hm?

69
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,440
You can remember people’s birthdays?

70
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,600
My seniors, juniors, professors, patients.

71
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,200
I can remember them all.

72
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,320
Let’s see…

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,880
Dr. Plakao?

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,200
Which date and month was he born?

75
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,600
October 1st.

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,680
And the nurses outside?

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,920
Vivi is June 15th.

78
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,160
Pupe is May 31st.

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,520
Did you just randomly throw out dates?

80
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,160
Nah. I can really remember them.

81
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,040
What about mine?

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,600
When’s my birthday?

83
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,600
Well…

84
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,480
Hey, hey, hey.

85
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,599
You can’t remember my birthday.

86
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
That’s kinda upsetting.

87
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
We’ve been together for 1 month, 5 days, and…

88
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,400
6 hours 32 minutes.

89
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,880
How come you can’t remember my birthday?

90
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,080
Don’t be upset.

91
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,880
I can remember this small detail.

92
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,920
You’re trying to peek at my medical profile?

93
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,240
No, I’m not.

94
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,800
I just did your physiotherapy

95
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,840
so I'm logging it in the patient chart.

96
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,480
Hey!

97
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,000
Don’t peek.

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,760
I didn’t.

99
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,880
Give me a break.

100
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,960
Then, when is my birthday?

101
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,160
Super easy.

102
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,080
Mr. Yoryak Phadetseuk born on December 6th.

103
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,760
You’re a Sagittarius.

104
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,400
Pretty good at peeking, Doc.

105
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,560
What do you mean? I didn’t peek a bit.

106
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,160
Anyway, I won. Now you owe me a coffee.

107
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,440
Hey, Doc.

108
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,000
Since when did I make a coffee deal with you?

109
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,200
Hey, Doc!

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,120
Welcome to Café for All.

111
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Hello, Mrs. Golf.

112
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,480
Hello, Dr. Dee.

113
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,000
What can I get for you today?

114
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,280
My usual, please.

115
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,560
Sure thing.

116
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,800
You are Yoryak, the future world champion, right?

117
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,080
You watch boxing too?

118
00:07:19,081 --> 00:07:20,800
Oh, I watch it for eye candy.

119
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,719
I mean I support all Thai boxers.

120
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,800
I always cheer for them.

121
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,919
Especially you, Yoryak.

122
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,760
You’re our hopeful world champion.

123
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,400
You have many fans, I see.

124
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,040
Of course.

125
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,680
Can I get a picture?

126
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,760
I want to post it on the café’s fan page.

127
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,600
Sure.

128
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,600
Dr. Wandee.

129
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,240
Yes?

130
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,480
Can you take a picture for me?

131
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,520
I want a picture with Yoryak.

132
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,560
Please.

133
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,159
Give me a good picture.

134
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,680
Make it look like we’re close.

135
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,720
Count for us too.

136
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,640
Just you two?

137
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,600
Yes.

138
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,480
Sure.

139
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,400
I’ll count.

140
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,800
1 2 3.

141
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,480
One more?

142
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,440
Yes, just in case.

143
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,040
Sure.

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,400
1 2 3.

145
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,640
Beautiful.

146
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,120
Thank you so much.

147
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,920
Can I see?

148
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,880
Is this good enough?

149
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,360
Yes.

150
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,080
Your cake’s ready.

151
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,560
What’s with the smile? It’s bugging me.

152
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
What? Why so grumpy?

153
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,160
Just because the café owner didn’t snap a pic of you for the page?

154
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,280
Not that.

155
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,320
She’s already posted loads of my pics there.

156
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,600
Really?

157
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,600
Yes.

158
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,960
Doc.

159
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,080
My shoulder problem won’t get worse, right?

160
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
I don’t think so.

161
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,000
But you should come in for physio more regularly.

162
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,880
Okay.

163
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,000
I’m running out of time before the championship fight.

164
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,200
You're currently ranked fifth, right?

165
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,480
Don't you need to work your way up to the top one by one?

166
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,080
Not necessarily.

167
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,280
When I feel confident and ready,

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,240
I can challenge opponents in any rank.

169
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,000
If I win, I can claim their rank.

170
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,839
So, you aim to dethrone the top rank	in the next fight

171
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,120
and become the world champion?

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,720
Of course...

173
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,120
not!

174
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,200
I'm not daring enough to challenge the top rank straight up.

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,560
I think I need one or two fights

176
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,360
to climb the ranks and also to earn money for the gym.

177
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,960
We're both getting closer to our goals.

178
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,480
You'll become a world champion,

179
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
and I'll secure the scholarship.

180
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
It's pretty nerve-wracking, isn't it?

181
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,360
Let's have a pre-celebration.

182
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,880
Cheers!

183
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,200
How was it?

184
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,400
The Sleepless Sleepwear.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,200
Dr. Wandee and his boyfriend are cute together.

186
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,080
The pictures of them giving a gift to a young patient?

187
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,480
Yes.

188
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,000
That was a smart move.

189
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,760
He leverages the engagement from Yoryak’s strong fanbase.

190
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,320
And the concept of this movement is solid too.

191
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,600
A good guy who does good things for children.

192
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,880
It can easily win people’s hearts.

193
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,240
I doubt Dee thinks that deeply.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,680
You think so?

195
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,680
Wow, Yoryak.

196
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,920
How does it make you feel when wearing?

197
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,880
It feels a bit strange in a good way.

198
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,320
What do you think, Yak?

199
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,200
I think if you can make the tail a bit longer,

200
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,480
it’ll look more realistic.

201
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,080
Ah, okay.

202
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,639
When you wear it, what score would you give it,

203
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,680
between 1 and 5?

204
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
5 means you really like it.

205
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,120
- 5 - 4.5

206
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Wow, more than 4!

207
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,040
Yes!

208
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,439
Alright, while you are waiting for the new one,

209
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,799
please continue using the bunny and tiger costumes you have

210
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,280
and try to create a new variety of ways to enjoy them.

211
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,600
Confused?

212
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,120
I mean, don’t limit them to just one idea.

213
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,280
The purpose of wearing them

214
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,600
is to break free from any constraints.

215
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,440
Keep exploring.

216
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,680
Come here.

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,400
Find joy in becoming someone else in your own way.

218
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,480
Tick-tock, tick-tock, bam!

219
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,400
I’m outta here.

220
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,920
Don’t forget to think about it.

221
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Wait, Doc!

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,400
When is your birthday?

223
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,880
October 1st.

224
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,400
Spot on!

225
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,400
What is this about?

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,840
Nothing.

227
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,920
Just a silly skepticism from someone around here.

228
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,760
You may go.

229
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,520
So?

230
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,800
Mr. Yoryak, born on 6th December under the sign of Sagittarius.

231
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,760
Hey, why the grumpy face?

232
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Does losing bother you?

233
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,080
Hey!

234
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,880
Yak.

235
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,280
Is there something on my face?

236
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,760
Why didn’t you hold me last night?

237
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,200
What?

238
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
And you didn’t turn to hold me at all until morning.

239
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,200
Oh, come on. There’s nothing to it.

240
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,480
You haven’t posted any photos of us on IG.

241
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,840
What’s with you again?

242
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:34,080
Not even a single IG Story of us.

243
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,920
I rarely use IG.

244
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,880
I only use it to promote our gym’s classes there. You know that.

245
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Are you seeing anyone besides me?

246
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,280
Have you gotten bored of me?

247
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,840
There.

248
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,880
You shook your head at me.

249
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,840
This is getting ridiculous, Cher.

250
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,640
Don’t be like this.

251
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,320
So are you telling me I’m acting childish?

252
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,960
How can I be as mature as you?

253
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,280
You are so far gone.

254
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
Not going to reconcile either?

255
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,400
What should I reconcile with you?

256
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,200
I don’t know what I did that upset you.

257
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,080
See?

258
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,400
You never care about me.

259
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,520
Cher!

260
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,400
Yei, get off me.

261
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,040
No, I won’t.

262
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,360
Get off me. You’re sticky.

263
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,960
I won’t.

264
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,880
Don’t be mad at me, little one.

265
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,200
Alright.

266
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,680
Now tell me what I did.

267
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,480
Can I say everything?

268
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,360
Anything you want to say.

269
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,440
Now tell me.

270
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,680
You haven’t…

271
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,400
gotten physical with me for days.

272
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,280
Just that?

273
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,920
Not just.

274
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Normally, you’re not like this.

275
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,320
So…

276
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,600
do you have anyone else?

277
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,400
Have you gotten bored of me already?

278
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,240
Done talking?

279
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,880
Fine.

280
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,640
I’m done.

281
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,920
How many nights do I owe you?

282
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,080
I’ll make up for all of them.

283
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,920
Alright. Let’s go to our room.

284
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,880
And brace yourself to get physical with me.

285
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,760
Like this one. Okay?

286
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,480
Then find a nice pair of pants like this.

287
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,680
With this kind of shirt?

288
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,480
Exactly.

289
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,440
But they look uncomfortable and make me super sweaty.

290
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,280
If Mr. Yoryak wants to change his look to impress Ms. Taemrak,

291
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,160
he'll have to endure.

292
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,480
Alright.

293
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,400
Along with a long-sleeved shirt and pants,

294
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,600
you should also find a nice jacket like this one.

295
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,280
And then there's your hair.

296
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,280
You should slick it back a bit.

297
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,960
With just these,

298
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,440
you'll look sharp and clean as if you’ve stepped out of the shower.

299
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Anything else?

300
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,640
Ah,

301
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,200
how about completing the look with a nice watch?

302
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,320
Whatever you think is best.

303
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,320
Come here.

304
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,200
Let me give you a reward.

305
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,760
Did you shop online again?

306
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,080
No.

307
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,200
I’ll go check who it is.

308
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,040
Surprise!

309
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,920
Grandma!

310
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,760
Hold it for me.

311
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,200
Where are you headed?

312
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,080
Inside.

313
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,360
Do you need to ask?

314
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,680
You are still very much you, my grandson.

315
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,400
Always been messy since young.

316
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,600
I’m just being consistent like you taught me.

317
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,120
There’s an activity with some volunteers over there today.

318
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,560
So I ran away.

319
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,000
You know that's so not my thing.

320
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,880
Yes, bailing out is more of your thing.

321
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,480
It’s great to have someone understand.

322
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,480
You wear size 56?

323
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,760
Grandma!

324
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,480
Come on.

325
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,080
Leave my stuff alone.

326
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,280
Just tell me where you want to go today.

327
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,280
I’ll keep you company.

328
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,080
I want to stay over a night here and spend quality time with my grandson.

329
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,800
Stay over?

330
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,760
That’s right.

331
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,480
We're the night owl grandma-grandson duo,

332
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,840
catching z's only as dawn breaks.

333
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,000
That’s fine.

334
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,080
But give me a heads up before you come over next time.

335
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,440
That way I can set aside my time for you

336
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,319
Here, you used to give me your schedule.

337
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,280
Let me find it.

338
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Here. Look.

339
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,160
Hello, young man.

340
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,920
Hello.

341
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,880
My name is Yoryak.

342
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,480
Keep pulling the pants up.

343
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,600
Oh, you are a boxer.

344
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
Yes, I’m a boxer.

345
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,280
He’s the future world champion too, Grandma.

346
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,160
Currently, you rank…

347
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,720
5th.

348
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,560
5th in his weight class.

349
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,840
So, he’s the reason you became interested in watching boxing.

350
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,080
Wow, the food you made looks very good.

351
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,600
Not my cooking,

352
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,679
but my talent for picking the right restaurant.

353
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,800
You know I can’t cook.

354
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,200
And you stay here as Dee’s roommate?

355
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,040
No.

356
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
I live alone.

357
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,800
It’s just that…

358
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,879
the AC in his room is not working.

359
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,879
So he stays here for the time being.

360
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,520
That’s right.

361
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,920
My AC is broken.

362
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,080
The blade inside exploded with a loud bang.

363
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,080
So I asked Dee to stay here.

364
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,240
But you’re staying over tonight, I should go back to my room.

365
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,159
No, you can also stay.

366
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,480
The more, the merrier.

367
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,400
You’ve become naughtier.

368
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,560
You have this kind of plush toy?

369
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,320
No. It’s from Kao.

370
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Yak and I are his experimental mice.

371
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,720
Dr. Plakao still has his quirks the same.

372
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,880
No, not the same.

373
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,200
He’s become more and more quirky over time.

374
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,280
That’s why he’s your friend.

375
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,680
Birds of a feather flock together.

376
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,800
It’s a shame I couldn’t see him this time.

377
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,200
He’s gone back to his hometown.

378
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,680
And what about Yoryak…

379
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,600
what’s the deal with him?

380
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,360
Well, it’s a good one.

381
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,440
Are you serious about him?

382
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,600
No.

383
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,480
Yak has someone already.

384
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,400
The relationship between me and him…

385
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,640
how should I call it?

386
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,720
Like there’s a status

387
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
but not really.

388
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,200
How do you feel to be in this kind of relationship?

389
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,680
I don’t feel anything.

390
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,600
The thing is, Yak and I–

391
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,280
We made a short-term agreement.

392
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,480
A very short one.

393
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,280
It’s so short that

394
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,280
I shouldn’t develop strong feelings toward him.

395
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:48,240
Stepping Over the Line

396
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,120
Yak!

397
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,120
Doc.

398
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,000
Why are you out here?

399
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,320
Checking on you.

400
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,320
I want to make sure you can sleep comfortably.

401
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,080
Very comfortable.

402
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,000
But I feel somewhat strange

403
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,680
for not having you to cuddle.

404
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,880
I’ve gotten used to having you in my arms.

405
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,880
Sure, I believe you.

406
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,000
Yak, what are you doing?

407
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,040
Grandma is here.

408
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,600
Just 5 minutes.

409
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,680
I need your power charge.

410
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,520
Okay.

411
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,200
Like this?

412
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,160
Yes.

413
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,000
Doc.

414
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,480
Do you think Taem will like me like you said?

415
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,200
Of course.

416
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,360
She’s going to fall for you for sure.

417
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,720
I can’t sleep.

418
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,240
Grandma!

419
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,360
Let’s find something fun to do.

420
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,920
Cheers.

421
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,160
Bottoms up, Grandma.

422
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,560
Grandma.

423
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,280
Yes?

424
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:50,200
May I record a video of you? You’re really cool.

425
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,600
You may.

426
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,160
But make sure to apply some filters before posting.

427
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,160
Noted, Mrs. Monthakarn.

428
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,600
Hold on.

429
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,400
Give me a sec, Grandma.

430
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,000
Here you go.

431
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,200
A cute accessory for the vid.

432
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,040
How cute.

433
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,320
Have a safe trip back.

434
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,400
I’ll find time to visit you.

435
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,560
Just come when you’re free.

436
00:27:41,561 --> 00:27:43,000
Don’t worry about it.

437
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,120
I know you’re busy.

438
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,720
I love you the most.

439
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,920
I love you the most too.

440
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,040
Yoryak.

441
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,680
Help look after Dee for me.

442
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,120
Ah…

443
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,880
I will.

444
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,400
Goodbye.

445
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,040
Here.

446
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,600
Goodbye.

447
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,280
Your grandmother is seriously cool.

448
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,040
Um.

449
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,920
Yak, do you need to go back to your gym now?

450
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,520
No.

451
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,800
Last night, Grandma stayed over at my place.

452
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,080
Mrs. Monthakarn is strong and healthy.

453
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,040
Don’t worry about her.

454
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,920
I regularly schedule her checkups.

455
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,120
I miss you, Dad, Mom.

456
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,000
What is it?

457
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,000
Don’t you think of introducing your boyfriend to your parents?

458
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,200
You mean fake boyfriend?

459
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,600
Keep it down.

460
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,520
You don’t want them to hear that.

461
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,240
Oh, please. Stop playing.

462
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,120
I’m not playing. I’m serious.

463
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Dad, Mom…

464
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,920
I’m Yoryak, Dee’s boyfriend.

465
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,520
He means he’s my fake boyfriend.

466
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,400
Fine.

467
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,400
We’re going to demonstrate exercises that can make your heart stronger.

468
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,920
We have our special guest demonstrator, Yoryak Phadetseuk.

469
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,600
Hello.

470
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,200
Let’s get started.

471
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,320
Action.

472
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,200
Here’s the demonstration for the first exercise.

473
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,600
First, raise your knee to waist level.

474
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,400
Then swing the hand that’s opposite your raised knee.

475
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,040
Do this alternately, like this.

476
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,080
Gradually increase your speed as you go,

477
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,520
like this.

478
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,040
Cut!

479
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,880
What’s making you so ecstatic?

480
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,400
This is seriously awesome.

481
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,600
Abacadabra, bless me with a high score, help me get the cut.

482
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,680
Are you dabbling in superstition too?

483
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,000
Yes. Thanks for helping me with your hotness here.

484
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,000
What are you talking about?

485
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,920
That’s nonsense.

486
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,520
You have an excursion later this week, right?

487
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,400
We don’t have the tutoring session then.

488
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,240
Yes.

489
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,000
But your scores have been improving lately.

490
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,320
A bit, yeah.

491
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,520
Besides my study notes, do you have anyone else to help you?

492
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,800
Dr. Dee?

493
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,120
Yes.

494
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,640
That’s great. I’d like to ask for his tips too sometimes.

495
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,720
But this video should be okay now.

496
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,960
You really look so cool here.

497
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,680
How fortunate to know such a cool senior like you.

498
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,320
You’ve changed your dressing style today.

499
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,480
Yes, I want to try something new.

500
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,920
How do I look? Do you like it?

501
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,120
Well, you look good.

502
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,320
A good unfamiliar look.

503
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,120
So what is the excursion about?

504
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,720
It’s a recreational excursion held by the Student Council team.

505
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,800
With Ohm?

506
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,200
Yeah, why do you ask?

507
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,160
Nothing.

508
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,680
So there should be a lot of people joining.

509
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,800
The senior team staff is around 30 already.

510
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,800
With the addition of junior students, there are over 100 people.

511
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,680
That sounds like fun with a lot of people.

512
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,800
Send me some pics and video clips too.

513
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,120
If you ask for it, you’ll get tons of them.

514
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,400
I don’t mind..

515
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,000
Don’t get annoyed by the spamming later.

516
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,800
But let’s find something to eat now.

517
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,240
I exerted too much earlier from the running.

518
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,000
I’m starving.

519
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,240
Sure. Your treat, okay?

520
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,680
Why are you following me?

521
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,240
Yei,

522
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,240
you scared me half to death.

523
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,000
Don’t tell me you followed me

524
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,040
because you suspect I’m cheating on you?

525
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
Well, it's possible, isn't it?

526
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,120
I’m meeting up with some promoters

527
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,120
to set up fights for Yak and Jo.

528
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,760
Stop imagining things.

529
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,400
For real?

530
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,920
Yes.

531
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,840
You can come with me if you want.

532
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,599
Didn’t you say you didn’t like hanging around

533
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
with those tough male promoters?

534
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,880
I’m not going.

535
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,160
You can go without me.

536
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,320
I’m going to order stuff for our gym and head back home.

537
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,640
Okay.

538
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,520
See you later when I’m home.

539
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,000
Okay?

540
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,120
Go home safely.

541
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,200
Hello, bro.

542
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,080
I’m almost there. See you.

543
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,000
How’s your preparation for the scholarship going?

544
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,080
I’m reviewing some recent journal articles

545
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,800
and compiling the findings from our department's research projects

546
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,000
to present at the upcoming national conference

547
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,280
and also at the international one.

548
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,200
Sounds good.

549
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,240
What about you?

550
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,520
Me too, sir

551
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,920
I’m preparing a new research project

552
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,120
on sarcoma of the bone treatment in children under 13 years old.

553
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,320
I’m not worried about your academic aspects now.

554
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,560
But don’t forget to run campaigns to raise awareness and understanding

555
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,320
about bones and joints too.

556
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,600
The votes play a part in your scholarship result.

557
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,000
I see.

558
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,800
I see, sir.

559
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,920
I heard that Dr. Ter has actively met with numerous media reps and KOLs.

560
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,920
If we compare the human body to a car,

561
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,320
bones serve as the machinery propelling you toward your intended destination.

562
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,200
He also has Dr. Kwan and Nurse Noinong canvassing votes from staff

563
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,840
Get ready to post that on your social media.

564
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
Count on me, Dr. Kwan.

565
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,360
My people are ready to share it.

566
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,840
They could gather voters like that.

567
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,600
Can we really outvote them?

568
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,600
Wait.

569
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,560
Who can vote?

570
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,800
The hospital staff, patients, and also relatives of the patients.

571
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,920
I think there’s still a way.

572
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,520
What is it?

573
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,400
You just continue doing what you do, Doc.

574
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,320
Leave the rest to me and my friends.

575
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,840
What are you waiting for?

576
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,000
Yoryak and his folks.

577
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,720
They’re not here yet.

578
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,160
Dr. Dee.

579
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,520
Yes?

580
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,320
Give it your full power today.

581
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,440
We’re ready.

582
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,600
We can’t wait to have fun with your activity.

583
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,720
Got it, champ.

584
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,640
I’ll start it in just a minute.

585
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,680
Oki.

586
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,280
It’s all set.

587
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,320
Alright.

588
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,080
It’s time.

589
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,840
Let’s begin.

590
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,200
We’re here, Doc!

591
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,000
Hello, Dr. Dee.

592
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,800
Hello.

593
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,320
You guys are just in time.

594
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,600
Sorry. We had to pick up Taem.

595
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,280
When she heard about this activity, she would like to join.

596
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,680
Please allow me to join such a great activity like this.

597
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,920
No problem at all.

598
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,120
Shall we start?

599
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,320
Hello, everyone.

600
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,880
Welcome to My Good Day My Choice.

601
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,760
We all can have a good day of our choice.

602
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,000
It’s hard to guess who will win or lose in this competition.

603
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,480
Me neither.

604
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,400
Oh, wow.

605
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,520
How’s it going, Namphu?

606
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,520
Look.

607
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,200
Dr. Wandee.

608
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,880
Can you do storytelling?

609
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,120
Storytelling?

610
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,840
Yep.

611
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,600
Sure thing.

612
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,240
But can I have a helper?

613
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,480
Who?

614
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,680
Roarrr!!

615
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,680
I’m Teeny Tiger!

616
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,840
I’m on a quest to find the Big Bunny.

617
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,519
Has anyone here seen the Big Bunny?

618
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,160
Where is it?

619
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,400
Did anyone see it?

620
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,240
It’s over there?

621
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,920
Oh, there’s the Big Bunny!

622
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,560
Big Bunny, are you coming out of there or not?

623
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,920
It doesn’t want to show up. Everyone, let’s shout for it.

624
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:35,040
Big Bunny! Big Bunny! Big Bunny!

625
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,640
Get out of there, Big Bunny!

626
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,120
Big Bunny! Big Bunny!

627
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,360
Yeah!

628
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,960
Today, Teeny Tiger and Big Bunny are going to tell you a story.

629
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,080
It’s called "Big Bunny and Teeny Tiger."

630
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,360
Here we are!

631
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,720
What’s up, buddy?

632
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,080
What’s up, Big Bunny?

633
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,320
Kids, today we have a story to tell you.

634
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,639
Who wants to hear it?

635
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,000
Raise your hand! Raise it high!

636
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,400
Wow, so many of you want to hear it!

637
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,320
Go ahead.

638
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,160
You all had such great energy.

639
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,600
You made the patients and their families happy.

640
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,800
Thank you so much.

641
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,920
With pleasure.

642
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,360
We need to do this at our camp anyway.

643
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,920
This is like a rehearsal.

644
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,040
Yak, let’s put these in the car.

645
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,520
Yeah, let’s do it.

646
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,920
I’ll help.

647
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,120
It’s alright. I’ve got this.

648
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,720
Stay with Dr. Dee.

649
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I’ll come get you when we’re done.

650
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,280
This too, right?

651
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,000
Yak told me you helped tutor him.

652
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,760
Ah. I used to study that subject before.

653
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,000
His scores improve, you know?

654
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,920
Fantastic.

655
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,200
I think it’s because of your study notes.

656
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,000
You cover all the key points in there.

657
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,800
We keep complimenting each other.

658
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,800
We’re still in the mood of the campaign.

659
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,920
My Good Day, My Choice.

660
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,400
Yak is fortunate to have you as his doctor.

661
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,200
Is that so?

662
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,120
Yes.

663
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,800
If you weren’t great, he wouldn’t have given you his personal necklace.

664
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,600
Taem, Phu will bring his car here.

665
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,160
Okay.

666
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,320
Alright then, I have to take off.

667
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,000
- See you later. - Bye.

668
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,600
See you too.

669
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,200
See ya.

670
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Later.

671
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,520
Why doesn't Mr. Yoryak go celebrate with those guys?

672
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,200
No.

673
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:35,960
Why?

674
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,800
Aren’t we supposed to be together tonight?

675
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,960
Hey.

676
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,960
Don’t bail.

677
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,800
Not gonna.

678
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,720
I really won’t.

679
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,320
Doctor.

680
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,200
Thank you so much for today.

681
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,120
I haven’t seen Koy smile widely like this for quite some time.

682
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,800
I’m grateful.

683
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,800
And here.

684
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,600
I’ve got this snack for you.

685
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,320
Please share with him.

686
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,720
Their snacks are really great.

687
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,000
Thank you so much.

688
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,160
Thank you.

689
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:12,880
You’re welcome.

690
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,600
Hey!

691
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,400
May I?

692
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,200
It’s really delicious.

693
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,120
Thank you again.

694
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,200
Enjoy it.

695
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,760
Please excuse me.

696
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,000
How could you do that in front of them?

697
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,800
You eat it too.

698
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,920
It really tastes good.

699
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,920
Try it.

700
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:36,920
This?

701
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,680
Yes.

702
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,200
Wow. It’s good.

703
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,000
Yoryak, your banana is big too.

704
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,760
That’s not big at all.

705
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,680
Come on. Put it here.

706
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,840
It’s not that big.

707
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,600
After the banana, we must add eggs, right?

708
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,840
Yes.

709
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,600
Here we go.

710
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:15,800
Oh.

711
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,840
What’re you doing?

712
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,600
Stop it.

713
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,560
You're using too much force.

714
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,520
The egg is all over your palm.

715
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,000
I couldn’t grab it properly.

716
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,400
I don’t get why you suddenly feel like baking.

717
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,920
Aren’t you exhausted enough from today?

718
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,520
The activity today makes me think of my grandma.

719
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,680
I want to bake this and give it to her.

720
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,200
So this is for Mrs. Monthakarn, my idol?

721
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,120
Okidoki.

722
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,440
I’ll do my best.

723
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,319
Dee, you just stand there and do nothing.

724
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,000
Leave it all to me.

725
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,200
You are so extra.

726
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,480
Why do we have to make it hard before eating this?

727
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,440
Isn’t it common?

728
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,520
If you want to eat good stuff,

729
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,120
you must learn to wait.

730
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,280
But I can eat you without having to wait.

731
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Hey, what nonsense are you speaking?

732
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,520
Focus on it.

733
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,480
Gotcha!

734
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,040
Oh, do you want to be baked in the oven too?

735
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,000
How cute.

736
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,440
No, Yak!

737
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,400
Yak!

738
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,320
You did so great today.

739
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,120
Not that great.

740
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,560
But I’m thankful for your help.

741
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,200
I’m on your team.

742
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,200
Thanks for bringing me here and treating me to this meal.

743
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,200
This place is really nice.

744
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,880
The food looks good too.

745
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,080
Do you know about this place from someone?

746
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,720
Ah, I found it from an internet review.

747
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,120
Ah.

748
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,280
Let's start eating.

749
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,120
What are you listening to? Can I hear it too?

750
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,720
Don't make me overstep any further

751
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,200
One look into your eyes and my stomach flutters

752
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,200
Stop before my heart falls any deeper

753
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,959
Ooh baby, I don’t know how to stop myself either

754
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,320
Then don't make me overstep any further

755
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:27,840
One look into your eyes and my stomach flutters

756
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,519
Stop before my heart falls any deeper

757
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,400
Ooh baby…

758
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,120
Hey, tiny dude, want to drink with us?

759
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,000
His name is Gooddy.

760
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,880
Ah.

761
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,960
What’s up, Gooddy?

762
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,600
Thank you, Yak, for today.

763
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,800
It should be me who says that.

764
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,040
You invited me to do a good thing.

765
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,000
Ouch.

766
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,320
What happened?

767
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,600
Got dust in your eye?

768
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,320
I guess.

769
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,480
Let me see.

770
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,080
What?

771
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,920
Actually, you have really sweet eyes, you know?

772
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,879
Then don't make me overstep any further

773
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,479
The cake should be ready. Let me go check it.
Then don't make me overstep any further

774
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:12,800
Then don't make me overstep any further

775
00:49:12,801 --> 00:49:17,920
One look into your eyes and my stomach flutters

776
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:23,240
Stop before my heart falls any deeper

777
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,799
Ooh baby, I don’t know how to stop myself either

778
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:33,360
Then don't make me overstep any further

779
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,879
One look into your eyes and my stomach flutters

780
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,959
Stop before my heart falls any deeper

781
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,399
(#GOODDY is kinda cute <3)
Stop before my heart falls any deeper

782
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,159
Ooh baby, I don’t know how to stop myself either
(#GOODDY is kinda cute <3)

783
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,680
Ooh baby, I don’t know how to stop myself either

784
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:58,720
(kinda cute #GOODDY)

785
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,600
Those are the toothbrushes you give to your young patients.

786
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,160
Yes.

787
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,920
They are cute.

788
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,000
I want to use them too.

789
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,800
Good. They are really cute.

790
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,200
Well then, mine is the left one, yours is the right one.

791
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:29,960
Why so?

792
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,600
It must be YoryakWandee.

793
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,320
Not WantdeeYoryak, right?

794
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,680
Why? Why can’t it be that?

795
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,760
Come here and brush your teeth.

796
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,680
Is that correct?

797
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:47,960
Yes.

798
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
No, it must be this.

799
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,320
Come on, Doc.

800
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,040
The first letter of my name comes before yours.

801
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,320
That's the Thai alphabetical order.

802
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,680
No.

803
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,240
Stop.

804
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,000
WandeeYoryak.

805
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,840
YoryakWandee.

806
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,480
WandeeYoryak.

807
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,400
YoryakWandee.

808
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,679
WandeeYoryak.

809
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,040
Hey, Yak! No.

810
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,000
Enough talk.

811
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,960
Yak, let’s go hang out together and just be ourselves.

812
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,680
I love you, Dee.

813
00:51:22,681 --> 00:51:25,600
I think Dr. Ter realizes how he feels about you.

814
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,880
Let him. I don’t care.

815
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,680
You must choose now who exactly you have feelings for.
