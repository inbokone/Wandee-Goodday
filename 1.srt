Why?

00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:56,629
Not feeling up to it anymore?

00:00:58,457 --> 00:00:59,289
Well…

Welcome to the G Championship, the stage of fearless fighters.

19
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:32,159
This match is in the 72.6-kg weight class, or middleweight.

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,550
In the red corner, aka the undefeated dashing fighter, Yoryak Phadetsuek.

How’d it go?

23
00:03:41,126 --> 00:03:42,482
Did your date go well last night?

24
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:44,678
It’s done.

25
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:47,338
(Damn. Why? Same as before?)

26
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:52,744
Yeah. I don’t think asexual exist in this country.

27
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,102
When I refused to sleep with him,

28
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:56,401
he wanted to break up with me.

The one you are looking for might be someone closer to you.

31
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:05,610
Dee, are you declaring your love for me?

32
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:07,340
I don’t mind.

33
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:09,338
But those eyebrows have got to go.

34
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:13,121
Your bushy eyebrows are such a turn-off.

35
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:14,768
Jackass.

36
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:16,375
Are you bullying my eyebrows?

37
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:25,262
(I know your heart has no room left for anyone else except for…)

38

(your Dr. Ter.)

39

Wait. I’ve got to go now.

40
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:33,880
Your driving was reckless.

41
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,764
How could you not see the car behind before turning right?

42
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:37,091
You need to be more cautious too.

43
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:38,335
Do you have the means to take responsibility?

44
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:39,158
Call the insurance.

45
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:40,285
No, you're the one who needs to take responsibility for my car.

46
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:41,420
Call the insurance.

47
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,031
Call the insurance. You’re wasting my time.

48
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:43,963
Please stop.

49
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:46,224
Who the hell are you?

50
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:47,169
Stay out of this.

00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:48,640
No!

Yak!

53
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:10,777
Throw your punch, for heaven’s sake!

54
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:17,764
Ouch.

55
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,891
Did you call an ambulance?

56
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:23,813
Yes.

57
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:26,524
But they said there were many accidents this morning.

58
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:27,861
So it’s not here yet.

What’re you waiting for?

What are you doing?

65
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,408
There’s likely a fracture in the fibula bone. Press it, please.

66
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:00,706
Are you a doctor or something?

67
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:02,576

Dr. Wandee.

71
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:14,434
I'm using an ice press to alleviate your pain and swelling.

72
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,001
If you don't want her to risk permanent damage,

73
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,738
don’t ever try to move her. Got it?

74
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:20,941
Thank you very much.

75
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:22,535
Keep pressing it.

76
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:45,395
That was ruthless.

77
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:49,605
This knockout took 4.26 seconds less than the previous one, Yak.

78
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:54,718
But the opponent’s punches are pretty strong, Cher.

79
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,923
Yes, you were at a disadvantage in the beginning.

80
00:06:57,923 --> 00:07:00,017
I was so worried about you, my son.

81
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:01,357
Hey.

82
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:03,727
When will you stop calling me your son?

83
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:06,568
Didn’t you say you love Oyei as if he were your father?

84
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:09,216
I never said that.

85
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:11,631
You said that when you were drunk.

86
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,520
I had a video clip of that.

87
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,064
Do you want to see it, my big baby?

88
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,217
Stop it or else I’ll kick you.

89
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:17,600
Do you dare to kick me?

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,357
Yes.

91
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:19,805
Yei.

92
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:21,852
Your little bro wants to kick me.

93
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:25,443
You want to kick my beau?

94
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:30,409
Yeah, any problem with that, Mr. Oyei Phadetsuek?

95
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,050
I do, Mr. Yoryak Phadetsuek.

96
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,428
I will…

97
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,540
join in the kicking too.

98
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,081
I knew it.

99
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,187
These two brothers are teaming up against me again.

100
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:42,764
You may kick me,

101
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:44,505
but you’re sleeping outside tonight.

102
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:46,087
No, babe.

103
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,844
I never want to kick you.

104
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:49,238
Yak drives a wedge between us.

105
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:50,762
How could I dare to kick you?

106
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:52,703
I still need you to…

107
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:55,937
Stop your dirty thoughts right now.

108
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,567
I called to book a checkup appointment for you.

109
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:05,911
Here’s the appointment.

110
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:10,154
3 p.m. today?

111
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:11,297
Yes.

112
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,617
But I already have other plans.

113
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,484
Then, take a rain check.

114
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:18,124
I’m serious about this.

115
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:20,000
I noticed you couldn’t move your shoulder freely.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,939
You should have a checkup.

117
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,716
Yeah. The sooner you check, the better.

118
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,328
We don’t have to pay a dime. This hospital is our sponsor.

119
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:28,063
You can see your girl at other times.

120
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,800
Girl?

121
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:39,371
I meant his fans.

122
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:40,549
Yak!

123
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:43,245
Do I need to remind you of your goal?

124
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:45,687
To be a world champion like you and Dad.

125
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:48,885
Alright, duly noted.

126
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,533
I'm heading to the hospital.

127
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:02,119
Alright.

128
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,026
Get back to our camp.

129
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:16,477
Dee.

130
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:24,404
I swung by the coffeeshop. I got one for you.

131
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:28,413
Latte, oatmilk, less sweet, extra shot.

132
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,155
Your usual, right?

133
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:31,910
Yes.

134
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,805
You remembered?

135
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:36,094
Of course.

136
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:38,570
It’s your favorite. How could I not remember?

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,965
Thank you.

138
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:53,831
You look good now.

139
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:19,475
Always a messy eater.

140
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:24,397
Sorry.

141
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:28,463
Being messy doesn't reflect well on our department’s image, huh?

142
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:29,672
Why apologize?

143
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:31,576
I actually find it kinda cute.

144
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:39,573
Oh, I have to get back to my patients.

145
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:44,120
I’ve just finished up my rounds too.

146
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,488
Later then.

147
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,880
Scream. Scream your lungs out.

148
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:02,097
Kao, why did you choose to sleep there of all places?

149
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:10,534
I asked why you slept under there?

150
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:13,299
I needed somewhere to mend my broken heart.

151
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:17,999
Did you see? It’s not just me, right?

152
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:20,348
Dr. Ter is really nice to me.

153
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:24,506
Listen, Dee. I think you should take it easy.

154
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,474
It's been almost eight years now,

155
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
and he's always treated me so nicely.

156
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:35,720
From day one, my heart's been fluttering like a 3-3.9 Richter quake.

157
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,546
Minor shaking—similar to how people indoors feel the passing of a train.

158
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:42,917
The day Dr. Ter asked me to work at the same hospital with him,

159
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,603
my heart shook even harder,

160
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,160
reaching a level of 5-5.9 on the Richter scale.

161
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,345
That's a strong shaking in a wider area—things indoors can move.

162
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:53,986
And when he asked me to buy a room in the same condo as his,

163
00:11:53,986 --> 00:11:55,652
it's like, same freaking condo, you know?

164
00:11:55,652 --> 00:11:57,716
And that's the same condo I live in too!

165
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,223
He helped me pick out every piece of furniture.

166
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:01,699
He's taken care of everything for me.

167
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:04,324
He nearly feeds me when we have dinner, you know.

168
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:07,887
Your heart shakes like a 6-6.9 Richter quake.

169
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:12,322
It's an intense shaking that can cause damage and collapse.

170
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,865
And did you see what he just did?

171
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:18,136
My heart is pounding so hard beyond a 7 on the Richter scale.

172
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,856
That's a severe and extreme shaking.

173
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:21,970
Buildings can be greatly damaged,

174
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,352
things on the ground can be tossed into the air,

175
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:27,388
just like the heart of Dr. Wandee, my dearest friend.

176
00:12:27,388 --> 00:12:28,755
You really understand me, my friend.

177
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:31,559
I'm sure Dr. Ter feels the same way.

178
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,047
In that case,

179
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,792
why hasn't he asked you to be his boyfriend yet?

180
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:42,940
He's a senior,

181
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,751
and he's also the face of this hospital.

182
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:47,392
It's probably difficult for him to make the first move.

183
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,955
But that's okay.

184
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:51,519
I'll make it easy for him.

185
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,389
By...

186
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:53,994
I'll ask him myself.

187
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,281
Just like that?

188
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:00,930
The next two days mark the anniversary of when we first met.

189
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,200
I'll ask him on that day.

190
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,869
And you know, eight is considered a lucky number–

191
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:07,490
infinity.

192
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,062
So, this love is infinite, right?

193
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,103
Get ready to celebrate the love between Dr. Ter and me.

194
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:15,610
I'll look forward to that.

195
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,943
Dr. Dee.

196
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:29,400
Yes?

197
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,307
Dr. Nop would like to talk to you.

198
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:34,868
Same thing again?

199
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:35,545
Yes.

200
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,394
Same time as before?

201
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:38,503
Exactly the same time.

202
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,134
Yes, Dr. Nop?

203
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,931
Dee, I need your help.

204
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,098
You haven't clocked out yet, have you?

205
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:01,891
Are you ready, sir?

206
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:07,860
Sir?

207
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,570
You're not the same doctor.

208
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:34,251
You seem alright.

209
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:35,768
I'm not.

210
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:37,625
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

211
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:41,628
I mean, you're not unconscious or passed out.

212
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,846
Why didn't you answer when I called you?

213
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:47,196
I was texting, so I didn't answer.

214
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:51,509
Wouldn't it be polite to at least respond?

215
00:14:56,898 --> 00:14:59,199
Anyway, if you're ready, let's get started.

216
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:07,819
Can I have a minute? I need to discuss something important with my friend.

217
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,738
Hey, mister.

218
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:15,307
The time of other patients outside is just as important as yours.

219
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:18,885
Okay, but I said I need a minute, Doc.

220
00:15:19,013 --> 00:15:20,168
Didn't you hear me?

221
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:29,461
Hey! That's my phone.

222
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,182
Consider it a social media detox.

223
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,067
It'll help you refocus and be with yourself.

224
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,965
Focus on what’s in front of you.

225
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:37,718
It also helps boost your mood.

226
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,018
Can you try lifting your arms?

227
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:55,916
Is this the furthest you can go with this one?

228
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:57,675
Yes, just this.

229
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:03,197
Does this hurt?

230
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:06,822
Um... no.

231
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,249
Ouch.

232
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:14,487
Didn't you say it didn't hurt?

233
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:16,510
What happened?

234
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:19,925
Didn't my record mention I'm a boxer?

235
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,714
So, you got knocked out and fell.

236
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:26,103
Did you fall on your chest too?

237
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:28,403
Any difficulty breathing afterward?

238
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:31,266
I won that bout. Never got knocked out by anyone.

239
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,191
Let me listen to your lungs and heart.

240
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:41,240
Take a deep breath in.

241
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:17,035
Can I ask?

242
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:19,349
You don't watch sports news?

243
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:20,952
You really don’t know who I am?

244
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:26,281
You have shoulder tendinitis, but otherwise, you're fine.

245
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,999
Except for the symptom of craving recognition.

246
00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:30,377
If you want treatment for that,

247
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:32,842
our psychiatry department is efficient.

248
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:34,169
I can refer you.

249
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,442
Tough doc, huh?

250
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:38,748
If you were my opponent, you'd be on the floor.

251
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:41,295
Want me to play along?

252
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:42,449
Happy to help.

253
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:44,827
"Oh, I'm really scared."

254
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:58,200
That patient really got on my nerves. What a jerk.

255
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,405
You weren't actually irritated that Dr. Nop asked you to cover for him and took it out on the patient, right?

256
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:05,320
No way.

257
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:09,115
Maybe just a bit.

258
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:11,181
You should have seen his face.

259
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,832
He's such a narcissist.

260
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:15,562
I wish I could refer him to your psychiatry department.

261
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:17,748
Is that so?

262
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:20,550
Take it easy, man.

263
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,637
Finish up here, head home, and shake off that bad mood.

264
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:25,365
I've still got my patients to take care of.

265
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:26,600
See you.

266
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,117
You talked about your patient behind his back.

267
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:37,391
Wouldn't that be considered impolite?

268
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,357
You're still here.

269
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:45,245
If I weren't here, I'd miss witnessing this in action.

270
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:48,335
A doctor in a top hospital in Bangkok

271
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,780
gossipped about his patient’s record.

272
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:52,312
Should I sue?

273
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:54,793
Do you have a voice recording?

274
00:18:56,163 --> 00:18:57,035
I wouldn't miss the chance.

275
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:58,515
Oh,

276
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:00,324
look at your pale face.

277
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,701
Where's that big-mouthed guy from earlier?

278
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,262
Hello, may I speak with Dr. Wandee?

279
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:08,480
Hey, I'm not your friend for you to mess around with.

280
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:10,500
I'm not your friend either.

281
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:11,721
Go ahead.

282
00:19:12,171 --> 00:19:13,662
Do whatever you want.

283
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:17,259
I can't be that mean to you.

284
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:21,107
I hope we don't have to see each other again,

285
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:22,574
Dr. Wandee.

286
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,209
[Are you still in the hospital? Come see me in the office.]

287
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:42,382
The hospital has planned to elevate our department to become the premier orthopedic facility.

288
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:46,736
That’s why our hospital chose to sponsor that outspoken boxer.

289
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,318
Mind your words, Wandee.

290
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:50,818
You are a doctor, and he’s a patient.

291
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:55,032
I saw that.

292
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,773
What can we do to help, sir?

293
00:20:01,256 --> 00:20:02,569
Prepare to study abroad.

294
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:03,984
The hospital will fund a scholarship,

295
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:06,392
but there’s only one spot available for this first scholarship.

296
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:09,994
Both of you have been selected as finalists by the board.

297
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:11,903
Me, really?

298
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,555
I’ll be competing with Dr. Ter for the crown?

299
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,681
Don’t say anything that might jeopardize your chance to win.

300
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:20,089
You’re a fan of beauty pageants too, I see.

301
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,851
Am I your joking buddy?

302
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:22,891
I’m kidding.

303
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,330
Take your time to think about it,

304
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,758
and let me know if you're interested in this scholarship.

305
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,417
Got it.

306
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:28,629
Understood, sir.

307
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:37,527
I don't care, Yei.

308
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:39,339
Next time, book me with a different doctor.

309
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:41,484
This one drives me crazy.

310
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:44,313
if I see him again, I’m gonna smack him.

311
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:47,916
(Relax. Let's talk about it when you're back.)

312
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,200
Alright.

313
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:54,880
Taem, are you finished?

314
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:56,332
Just a moment.

315
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:03,019
Your boyfriend is so hot.

316
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,288
He's just a friend, not a boyfriend.

317
00:21:05,716 --> 00:21:06,600
What part are you working on?

318
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,363
Have you solved the problem yet?

319
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:07,972
Let me see.

320
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:09,384
I’m yet to get on it.

321
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:14,708
Here, I finished it for you.

322
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,100
You can hand this over to your professor.

323
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:18,125
Another assignment must be submitted via email.

324
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,684
I’ll make sure to send it no later than tonight.

325
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,700
Okay.

326
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:29,087
I’m going to graduate for real this year thanks to your help.

327
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:31,661
At your service, sir.

328
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:33,661
You can have more time for boxing.

329
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:34,895
Leave this to me.

330
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:35,866
Okay.

331
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:39,010
Cash or wire?

332
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:45,521
Alright, I’ll wire it now.

333
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:49,536
Here.

334
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:51,122
Thank you for your business.

335
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,559
Looking forward to serving you again.

336
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:56,136
You are such a money-maker.

337
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:58,429
You are a tutor for high school students,

338
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,948
and also handle assignments for me.

339
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:03,962
Being poor is scary.

340
00:22:10,386 --> 00:22:10,986
Taem.

341
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:11,486
Hmm?

342
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:14,805
You said…

343
00:22:15,895 --> 00:22:17,279
you would come cheer for me at the ringside.

344
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:18,645
How come you...

345
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,519
I said I would go if I was free.

346
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,970
But you saw that I had a tutoring job, right?

347
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:26,899
Yes, I did see, but...

348
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:27,856
Come on, Yak.

349
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,720
I think it's okay to keep our relationship like this.

350
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,504
Come on, Taem.

351
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:37,615
I'm yet to finish my delivery to your doorstep.

352
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:39,117
You returned it before it reached there.

353
00:22:39,117 --> 00:22:40,343
Can't you let me finish it?

354
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:42,367
I know you too well.

355
00:22:45,471 --> 00:22:46,293
I can’t believe you.

356
00:22:48,862 --> 00:22:51,212
Here, let me explain about your papers.

357
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,697
For this subject—

358
00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:05,605
- Dr. Ter.
- Dee.

359
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:09,647
We spoke at the same time.

360
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:10,989
I know.

361
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:12,417
We share the same mind.

362
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:13,512
You go first.

363
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:17,920
The day after tomorrow, you are free in the evening, right?

364
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,149
Yes.

365
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:22,207
How about grabbing dinner together?

366
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:24,791
I want to chat with you about something.

367
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:25,915
Really?

368
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,057
I have something to discuss with you too.

369
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:29,327
Really?

370
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:32,640
I’ll send you the location of the restaurant later.

371
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:35,354
Do you want to go there together

372
00:23:35,787 --> 00:23:37,081
or meet there?

373
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:38,754
Let’s meet there.

374
00:23:38,947 --> 00:23:41,635
I have a meeting with a YouTuber.

375
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:43,641
Alright,

376
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,277
see you then.

377
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:46,253
See you.

378
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,331
Kao, my bud.

379
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:11,711
What the hell is wrong with you?

380
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:13,142
Nothing's wrong with me.

381
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:17,361
But these are my last two days of being single.

382
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,354
Are you really going to do it?

383
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,717
Just two days left.

384
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,846
Dr. Ter and I are finally closing the chapter on eight years in the brother zone

385
00:24:25,745 --> 00:24:29,700
and starting a new chapter as the couple of the year.

386
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,360
Can’t wait to see it.

387
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:32,660
You’ll see it.

388
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:46,542
Wow.

389
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:49,428
Is the food here alright?

390
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:51,711
It's actually pretty good.

391
00:24:52,469 --> 00:24:54,240
I always trust your taste when it comes to food.

392
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:56,225
Everything I've had with you has been delicious.

393
00:24:58,456 --> 00:24:59,097
Dr. Ter,

394
00:25:01,622 --> 00:25:02,856
I think…

395
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,856
No, I mean we can still be in the relationship.

396
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:07,350
I still want some physical affection.

397
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,926
But...

398
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,926
I don't want to have sex. Do you get it?

399
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,178
No, I don't.

400
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:15,190
It's not that difficult to understand.

401
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,627
Kao, come with me.

402
00:25:17,006 --> 00:25:17,932
What, Dee?

403
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,490
Are you okay?

404
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,762
Stop asking me if I’m okay or not.

405
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:26,863
I’m not okay, so I’m here to see you.

406
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,621
What happened?

407
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:37,256
Eating with you like this reminds me of the old days.

408
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:41,870
How long have we known each other?

409
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,819
Holy shit, Dr. Ter started first?

410
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:47,461
What did you say to him?

411
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:48,896
Eight years.

412
00:25:49,317 --> 00:25:50,918
Today marks exactly eight years.

413
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:53,301
You showed him you have an excellent memory too.

414
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:53,959
Really?

415
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,996
Yes.

416
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:57,174
On this day eight years ago,

417
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:58,758
I was a freshman.

418
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:00,941
And you were the student activities president.

419
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:04,897
You were the freshman who often passed out at gatherings.

420
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:08,021
You made me worried then.

421
00:26:08,715 --> 00:26:11,092
I'm still worried about you even now, you know.

422
00:26:12,818 --> 00:26:13,490
Hey,

423
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:15,927
it sounded like in the right moment, didn’t it?

424
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:17,098
I know, right?

425
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:20,200
So I gathered all the courage I have

426
00:26:21,262 --> 00:26:22,226
and…

427
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:30,880
Dr. Ter.

428
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:35,164
We’ve known each other for eight years.

429
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:38,385
I think…

430
00:26:42,594 --> 00:26:43,876
I like you.

431
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:55,288
And I’m sure you know in what way I like you.

432
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,295
Dee.

433
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:02,857
I like you too.

434
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:09,459
But...

435
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:15,120
I don’t like you in that way.

436
00:27:23,014 --> 00:27:23,670
Damn.

437
00:27:24,785 --> 00:27:25,792
Totally a mood killer.

438
00:27:27,303 --> 00:27:30,797
And what was between us all this time?

439
00:27:32,475 --> 00:27:33,243
We're like brothers.

440
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:34,496
Brothers?

441
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:38,862
What about how well you've treated me all this time?

442
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,661
You've consistently taken good care of me.

443
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,031
That's more than what brothers typically do for each other, I think.

444
00:27:43,852 --> 00:27:44,999
Listen, Dee.

445
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:48,774
I like girls.

446
00:27:51,047 --> 00:27:52,084
I'll let you say it again.

447
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:53,664
My answer will always be the same.

448
00:27:53,664 --> 00:27:54,640
I like girls.

449
00:27:58,497 --> 00:27:59,639
Dr. Kwan?

450
00:28:00,923 --> 00:28:02,012
Dr. Kwan what?

451
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:04,378
You like feisty girls

452
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:06,183
like Dr. Kwan,

453
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,302
like those people talked about you.

454
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:10,294
That has nothing to do with this.

455
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:12,805
It has. Then why don’t you like me?

456
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:14,019
Dee.

457
00:28:14,187 --> 00:28:17,417
Tell me. Regardless of what gender I am,

458
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:18,910
why don’t you like me?

459
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:23,000
You are too vanilla for me.

460
00:28:26,814 --> 00:28:27,771
Too vanilla?

461
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:30,878
Okay.

462
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:32,643
I get it now.

463
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:38,645
Me trying to be a decent person to you is too vanilla.

464
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,720
Being decent is vanilla, you say?

465
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,378
Dee. It’s not what I meant.

466
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:45,819
You are still…

467
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:47,975
like a brother to me.

468
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,927
So the chapter of being brothers for eight has come to an end.

469
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:54,566
Not yet.

470
00:28:55,513 --> 00:28:56,270
But nearly.

471
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,817
There’s more.

472
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:00,924
Dee.

473
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,076
Dee, wait.

474
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:18,760
Damn, don’t tell me he realized his feelings

475
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:20,549
and wants you back?

476
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:22,699
The scholarship…

477
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:24,619
can you let me have it, bro?

478
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:27,607
Damn.

479
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:32,627
Kao,

480
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,169
tonight

481
00:29:34,547 --> 00:29:36,547
I want to get wasted!

482
00:29:42,535 --> 00:29:44,851
So he wanted that scholarship so bad that he accepted my date.

483
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:47,874
I won’t back down. I will go for it.

484
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,147
Damn. Good boy gone bad.

485
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:55,880
Aren’t you going to be a good little bro to him anymore?

486
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:01,043
I’ll be wild tonight.

487
00:30:01,043 --> 00:30:01,787
Hey, Dee.

488
00:30:02,328 --> 00:30:03,750
It’s not the same thing.

489
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,001
You can’t mix up everything like fusion food.

490
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:07,926
I don’t care.

491
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:09,825
I’ll be wild tonight.

492
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:12,790
I’m no longer that plain vanilla kind of guy. Get it?

493
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:14,759
Alright.

494
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,178
Knock yourself out then.

495
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:52,144
Am I wild yet?

496
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,002
Do whatever you’re pleased, man.

497
00:31:28,282 --> 00:31:32,465
There must be something I did wrong. I never get it even once.

498
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,487
Why don’t you put the melody to those lyrics too?

499
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:35,771
Isn’t it strange?

500
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:37,663
People seemed to be interested in me.

501
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:39,674
But none approached me.

502
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:41,811
How come no one invited me home with them?

503
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:47,868
